The increase in cost-per-impression from 2021 to 2022 was driven by a number of interrelated factors including ongoing product and policy changes, improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery, changes in device mix, geographic mix, product mix, and property mix, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates.</span></div><div><span>Google other revenues</span></div><div><span>Google other revenues increased $1.0 billion from 2021 to 2022 primarily driven by growth in YouTube non-advertising and hardware revenues, partially offset by a decrease in Google Play revenues. The growth in YouTube non-advertising was largely due to an increase in paid subscribers. The growth in hardware was primarily driven by increased sales of Pixel devices. The decrease in Google Play revenues was primarily driven by the fee structure changes we announced in 2021 as well as a decrease in buyer spending. Additionally, the overall increase in Google other revenues was adversely affected by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates.</span></div><div><span>Google Cloud</span></div><div><span>Google Cloud revenues increased $7.1 billion from 2021 to 2022. The growth was primarily driven by Google Cloud Platform followed by Google Workspace offerings. Google Cloud's infrastructure and platform services were the largest drivers of growth in Google Cloud Platform.</span></div><div></div><div><span>Revenues by Geography</span></div><div><span>The following table presents revenues by geography as a percentage of revenues, determined based on the addresses of our customers:</span></div><div><table><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><span> </span></td><td></td><td></td><td><span>Year Ended December 31,</span></td></tr><tr><td><span> </span></td><td></td><td></td><td><span>2021</span></td><td></td><td><span>2022</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>United States</span></td><td></td><td></td><td><span>46 </span></td><td><span>%</span></td><td></td><td><span>48 </span></td><td><span>%</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>EMEA</span></td><td></td><td></td><td><span>31 </span></td><td><span>%</span></td><td></td><td><span>29 </span></td><td><span>%</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>APAC</span></td><td></td><td></td><td><span>18 </span></td><td><span>%</span></td><td></td><td><span>16 </span></td><td><span>%</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>Other Americas</span></td><td></td><td></td><td><span>5 </span></td><td><span>%</span></td><td></td><td><span>6 </span></td><td><span>%</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>Hedging gains (losses)</span></td><td></td><td></td><td><span>0 </span></td><td><span>%</span></td><td></td><td><span>1 </span></td><td><span>%</span></td></tr></table></div><div><span>For further details on revenues by geography, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.</span></div><div><span>Use of Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information</span></div><div><span>International revenues, which represent a significant portion of our revenues, are generally transacted in multiple currencies and therefore are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.</span></div><div><span>The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons. We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues ("constant currency revenues") and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues ("percentage change in constant currency revenues") for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) results helps improve the ability to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.</span></div><div><span>Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements ("FX Effect") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.</span></div><div><div><div><span>33</span></div></div></div>
