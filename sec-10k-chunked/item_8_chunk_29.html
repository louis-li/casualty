We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.</span></div><div><span>It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. </span></div><div><span>As of December 31, 2022, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible. </span></div><div><span>Legal Matters</span></div><div><span>We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.</span></div><div><span>Certain outstanding matters include speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and we may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding legal matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect.</span></div><div><span>We expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.</span></div><div><span>Antitrust Investigations</span></div><div><span>On November 30, 2010, the EC's Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various antitrust-related complaints against us. </span></div><div><span>On June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display and ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €<ix:nonfraction>2.4</ix:nonfraction> billion ($<ix:nonfraction>2.7</ix:nonfraction> billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision to the General Court, and on September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into compliance with the EC's decision. We recognized a charge of $<ix:nonfraction>2.7</ix:nonfraction> billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2017. On November 10, 2021, the General Court rejected our appeal, and we subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice on January 20, 2022.</span></div><div><span>On July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google’s Android-related distribution agreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €<ix:nonfraction>4.3</ix:nonfraction> billion ($<ix:nonfraction>5.1</ix:nonfraction> billion as of June 30, 2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision, and on October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution practices. On September 14, 2022, the General Court reduced the fine from €<ix:nonfraction>4.3</ix:nonfraction> billion to €<ix:nonfraction>4.1</ix:nonfraction> billion. We subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice. In 2018, we recognized a charge of $<ix:nonfraction>5.1</ix:nonfraction> billion for the fine, which we reduced by $<ix:nonfraction>217</ix:nonfraction> million in 2022.</span></div><div><span>On March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that Google had with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine of €<ix:nonfraction>1.5</ix:nonfraction> billion ($<ix:nonfraction>1.7</ix:nonfraction> billion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners' agreements, which we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed the EC decision, which remains pending. We recognized a charge of $<ix:nonfraction>1.7</ix:nonfraction> billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019.</span></div><div><span>From time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition matters by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally.
