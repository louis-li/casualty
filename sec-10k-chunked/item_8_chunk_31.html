The subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially different from our expectations.</span></div><div><span>For information regarding income tax contingencies see Note 14.</span></div></ix:continuation><div></div><div><span>Note 11. <ix:nonnumeric>Stockholders' Equity </ix:nonnumeric></span></div><ix:continuation><div><span>Class A and Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock</span></div><div><span>Our Board of Directors has authorized <ix:nonfraction>three</ix:nonfraction> classes of stock, Class A and Class B common stock, and Class C capital stock.

Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares. The dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A stock assumes the conversion of Class B stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B stock does not assume the conversion of those shares.</ix:continuation></span></div><div><div><div><span>76</span></div></div></div>
