By 2030, we aim to:</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>achieve net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain, including our consumer hardware products;</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>become the first major company to run on carbon-free energy 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year;</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>enable 5 gigawatts of new carbon-free energy through investments in our key manufacturing regions; and</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>help more than 500 cities and local governments reduce an aggregate of 1 gigaton (one billion tons) of carbon emissions annually.</span></div><div><span> We also aim to maximize the reuse of finite resources across our operations, products, and supply chains and to enable others to do the same.</span></div><div><span> We are committed to helping people make more sustainable choices by empowering them with technology. We introduced eco-friendly routing in Google Maps; new features to book flights or purchase appliances that have lower carbon footprints; and when people come to Google Search with questions about climate change, we show information from authoritative sources like the United Nations.</span></div><div><span>To benefit the people and places where we operate, we have set goals to replenish more water than we consume by 2030 and to support water security in communities where we operate. We are focused on three areas: enhancing our stewardship of water resources across Google offices and data centers; replenishing our water use and improving watershed health and ecosystems in water-stressed communities; and sharing technology and tools that help everyone predict, prevent, and recover from water stress. At Google we remain steadfast in our commitment to sustainability, and we will continue to lead and encourage others to join us in improving the health of our planet. We are proud of what we have achieved so far, and we are energized to help move the world closer to a more sustainable and carbon-free future for all.</span></div><div><span>More information on our approach to sustainability can be found in our annual sustainability reports, including Google’s Environmental Report.
