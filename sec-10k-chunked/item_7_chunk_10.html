These losses were partially offset by interest income of $2.2 billion and reversals of previously accrued performance fees related to certain investments of $798 million. In 2021, $9.8 billion of net unrealized gains were recognized on non-marketable equity securities and $1.5 billion of interest income was recognized, partially offset by $1.9 billion of accrued performance fees related to certain investments.</span></div><div><span>See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.</span></div><div></div><div><span>Provision for Income Taxes</span></div><div><span>The following table presents provision for income taxes (in millions, except for effective tax rate):</span></div><div><table><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><span> </span></td><td></td><td></td><td><span>Year Ended December 31,</span></td></tr><tr><td><span> </span></td><td></td><td></td><td><span>2021</span></td><td></td><td><span>2022</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>Income before provision for income taxes</span></td><td></td><td></td><td><span>$</span></td><td><span>90,734 </span></td><td></td><td></td><td><span>$</span></td><td><span>71,328 </span></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><span>Provision for income taxes</span></td><td></td><td></td><td><span>$</span></td><td><span>14,701 </span></td><td></td><td></td><td><span>$</span></td><td><span>11,356 </span></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><span>Effective tax rate</span></td><td></td><td></td><td><span>16.2 </span></td><td><span>%</span></td><td></td><td><span>15.9 </span></td><td><span>%</span></td></tr></table></div><div><span>The effective tax rate decreased from 2021 to 2022, primarily driven by the effects of capitalization and amortization of R&amp;D expenses in 2022 as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act generating an increase in the U.S. federal Foreign Derived Intangible Income tax deduction.
