Technological feasibility is typically reached shortly before the release of such products. As a result, development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented.</span></div><div><span>Software development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and cloud-based applications used to deliver our services. We capitalize development costs related to these software applications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications were not material for the periods presented.</span></div></ix:nonnumeric><ix:nonnumeric><div><span>Stock-based Compensation</span></div><div><span>Stock-based compensation primarily consists of Alphabet restricted stock units (RSUs). RSUs are equity classified and measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. We recognize RSU expense using the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur.</span></div><div><span>For RSUs, shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory income tax withholding to be paid by us on behalf of our employees. As a result, fewer shares are issued than the number of RSUs outstanding, and the income tax withholding is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.</span></div><div><span>Additionally, stock-based compensation includes other stock-based awards, such as performance stock units (PSUs) that include market conditions and awards that may be settled in cash or the stock of certain Other Bets. PSUs and certain Other Bet awards are equity classified and expense is recognized over the requisite service period. Certain Other Bet awards are liability classified and remeasured at fair value through settlement. The fair value of Other Bet awards is based on the equity valuation of the respective Other Bet.</span></div></ix:nonnumeric><div><span><ix:nonnumeric>Advertising and Promotional Expenses</ix:nonnumeric></span></div><div><span><ix:continuation>We expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred.</ix:continuation> For the years ended </span><span>December 31, 2020</span><span>, 2021, and 2022, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $<ix:nonfraction>5.4</ix:nonfraction> billion, $<ix:nonfraction>7.9</ix:nonfraction> billion, and $<ix:nonfraction>9.2</ix:nonfraction> billion, respectively.</span></div><ix:nonnumeric><div><span>Performance Fees</span></div><div><span>Performance fees refer to compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain investments.
