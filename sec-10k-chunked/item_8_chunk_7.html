Actual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; fair values of financial instruments, intangible assets, and goodwill; inventory; useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment; income taxes; and contingent liabilities, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.</span></div></ix:nonnumeric><div><span><ix:continuation>In January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and adjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from <ix:nonnumeric>four years</ix:nonnumeric> to <ix:nonnumeric>six years</ix:nonnumeric> and the estimated useful life of certain network equipment from <ix:nonnumeric>five years</ix:nonnumeric> to <ix:nonnumeric>six years</ix:nonnumeric>.
