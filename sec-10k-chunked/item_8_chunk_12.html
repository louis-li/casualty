Cost is computed using the first-in, first-out method.</span></div></ix:nonnumeric><ix:nonnumeric><div><span>Variable Interest Entities</span></div><div><span>We determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in which we have other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity (VIE). We consolidate VIEs when we are the primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses or benefits. If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.</span></div><div><span>Periodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination of whether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary. </span></div></ix:nonnumeric><ix:nonnumeric><div><span>Property and Equipment</span></div><div><span>Property and equipment includes the following categories: land and buildings, information technology assets, construction in progress, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures. Land and buildings include land, offices, data centers, and related building improvements. Information technology assets include servers and network equipment. Construction in progress is the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service. </span></div><div><span>We account for property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which we regularly evaluate. Land is not depreciated. We depreciate buildings over periods of <span>seven</span> to <ix:nonnumeric>25</ix:nonnumeric> years. We depreciate information technology assets generally over periods of <span>four</span> to <ix:nonnumeric>five years</ix:nonnumeric> (generally, <ix:nonnumeric>four years</ix:nonnumeric> for servers and <ix:nonnumeric>five years</ix:nonnumeric> for network equipment). We depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation for buildings, information technology assets, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures commences once they are ready for our intended use.</span></div></ix:nonnumeric><ix:nonnumeric><div><span>Leases</span></div><div><span>We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-lease components. Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed. Non-lease components primarily include payments for maintenance and utilities. We combine fixed payments for non-lease components with lease payments and account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets and liabilities.</span></div><div><span>Certain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the lease assets and liabilities. These amounts include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index, payments contingent on wind or solar production for power purchase arrangements, and payments for maintenance and utilities.</span></div><div><span>Lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our incremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, and in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Our lease terms include periods under options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally use the base, non-cancelable, lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Lease assets also include any prepaid lease payments and lease incentives.</span></div><div><span>Operating lease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The current portion of our operating lease liabilities is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and the long-term portion is included in operating lease liabilities. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment, net. Finance lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or long-term debt.</span></div><div><span>Operating lease expense (excluding variable lease costs) is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.</span></div></ix:nonnumeric><ix:nonnumeric><div><span>Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets</span></div><div><span>We review property and equipment and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. We measure recoverability of these assets by </span></div></ix:nonnumeric></ix:continuation><div><div><div><span>57</span></div></div></div>
