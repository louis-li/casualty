Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $<ix:nonfraction>3.8</ix:nonfraction> billion, $<ix:nonfraction>5.2</ix:nonfraction> billion, and $<ix:nonfraction>7.1</ix:nonfraction> billion as of </span><span>December 31, 2020</span><span>, 2021, and 2022, respectively, of which $<ix:nonfraction>2.6</ix:nonfraction> billion, $<ix:nonfraction>3.7</ix:nonfraction> billion, and $<ix:nonfraction>5.3</ix:nonfraction> billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate, respectively. </span></div><div><span>As of </span><span>December 31, 2021</span><span> and 2022, we accrued $<ix:nonfraction>270</ix:nonfraction> million and $<ix:nonfraction>346</ix:nonfraction> million in interest and penalties in provision for income taxes, respectively.</span></div><div><span>We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. Our <ix:nonfraction>two</ix:nonfraction> major tax jurisdictions are the U.S. federal and Ireland. We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. The IRS is currently examining our 2016 through 2018 tax returns. We have also received tax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or permanent establishment. We continue to defend any and all such claims as presented.</span></div><div><span>The tax years 2015 through 2021 remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Irish tax purposes. There are other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statements.</span></div><div><span>We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the effect, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.</span></div><div><span>We believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolutions occur. Although the timing of resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is not certain, it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits from certain U.S. federal, state, and non U.S. tax positions could decrease by approximately $<ix:nonfraction>1.8</ix:nonfraction> billion in the next 12 months. Positions that may be resolved include various U.S. and non-U.S. matters.</span></div></ix:continuation><div></div><div><span>Note 15. <ix:nonnumeric>Information about Segments and Geographic Areas </ix:nonnumeric></span></div><ix:continuation><div><span>We report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Google Maps, Google Play, Search, and YouTube.
