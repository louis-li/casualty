We recognize revenues for performance advertising when a user engages with the advertisement, such as a click, a view, or a purchase. For brand advertising, we recognize revenues when the ad is displayed, or a user views the ad.</span></div><div><span>For ads placed on Google Network properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed on Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues, and amounts paid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of revenues. Where we are the principal, we control the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing.</span></div><div><span>Google Cloud Revenues</span></div><div><span>Google Cloud revenues consist of revenues from:</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>Google Cloud Platform, which includes fees for infrastructure, platform, and other services;</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>Google Workspace, which includes fees for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for enterprises, such as Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar, and Meet; and </span></div><div><span>•</span><span>other enterprise services.</span></div><div><span>Our cloud services are generally provided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may have contract terms longer than a year. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis are recognized when the customer utilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the cloud services.</span></div><div><span>Google Other Revenues </span></div><div><span>Google other revenues consist of revenues from:</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>Google Play, which includes sales of apps and in-app purchases;</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>hardware, which includes sales of Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel devices;</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>YouTube non-advertising, which includes subscription revenues from services such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV; and</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>other products and services.</span></div><div><span>We report revenues from Google Play app sales and in-app purchases on a net basis, because our performance obligation is to facilitate a transaction between app developers and end users, for which we earn a service fee. </span></div><div><span>Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations</span></div><div><span>Our contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations.

We estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration.</span></div><div><span>Sales Commissions</span></div><div><span>We expense sales commissions when incurred when the amortization period (the period of the expected benefit) is one year or less. We recognize an asset for certain sales commissions if we expect the period of benefit of these costs to exceed one year and recognize the expense over the amortization period. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses.</span></div><div><span>Cost of Revenues</span></div><div><span>Cost of revenues consists of TAC and other costs of revenues.</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>TAC includes: </span></div></ix:continuation></ix:continuation><div><div><div><span>53</span></div></div></div>
