While these early-stage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty, some of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their industries. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.</span></div><div></div><div><span>Competition</span></div><div><span>Our business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies. We face formidable competition in every aspect of our business, including, among others, from:</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>general purpose search engines and information services;</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>vertical search engines and e-commerce providers for queries related to travel, jobs, and health, which users may navigate directly to rather than go through Google;</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>online advertising platforms and networks;</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>other forms of advertising, such as billboards, magazines, newspapers, radio, and television as our advertisers typically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline;</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>digital content and application platform providers;</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>providers of enterprise cloud services;</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that have developed proprietary platforms;</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>providers of digital video services; </span></div><div><span>•</span><span>social networks, which users may rely on for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information through traditional search engines;</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>providers of workspace communication and connectivity products; and </span></div><div><span>•</span><span>digital assistant providers.</span></div><div><span>Competing successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and technologies to the marketplace across our businesses. For example, for advertising, competing successfully depends on attracting and retaining:</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance of our advertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and availability of our products and services;</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver their advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels; and</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>content providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.</span></div><div><span>For additional information about competition, see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. </span></div><div></div><div><span>Ongoing Commitment to Sustainability</span></div><div><span>We believe that every business has the opportunity and obligation to protect our planet. Sustainability is one of our core values at Google, and we strive to build sustainability into everything we do. We have been a leader on sustainability and climate change since Google’s founding more than 20 years ago. These are some of our key achievements over the past two decades:</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>In 2007, we became the first major company to be carbon neutral for our operations.</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>In 2017, we became the first major company to match 100% of our annual electricity use with renewable energy, which we have achieved for five consecutive years.</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>In 2020, we issued $5.75 billion in sustainability bonds—the largest sustainability or green bond issuance by any company in history at the time. The net proceeds from the issuance were used to fund environmentally and socially responsible projects in the following eight areas: energy efficiency, clean energy, green buildings, clean transportation, circular economy and design, affordable housing, commitment to racial equity, and support for small businesses and COVID-19 crisis response. As of 2022, we had fully allocated the net proceeds from our sustainability bonds as outlined in our Sustainability Bond Impact Report published in 2022.</span></div><div><span>Our sustainability strategy is focused on three key pillars: accelerating the transition to carbon-free energy and a circular economy, empowering everyone with technology, and benefiting the people and places where we operate.</span></div><div><div><div><span>7</span></div></div></div>
