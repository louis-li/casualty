Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in </span><span>Internal Control—Integrated Framework</span><span> issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with our Audit and Compliance Committee. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of </span><span>December 31, 2022</span><span> has been audited by Ernst &amp; Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.</span></div><div><span>Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures</span></div><div><span>In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.</span></div><div></div><div></div>
