In addition, we offer services such as\ncolocation, resale and unbundled network elements in compliance with\napplicable regulations.\n\n  \n\n| |   \n---|---|---  \nDistribution  \n  \nWe use a combination of direct, indirect and alternative distribution channels\nto market and distribute our products and services to Consumer and Business\ncustomers.\n\n  \n\nOur direct channel, including our company-operated stores, is a core component\nof our distribution strategy. Our sales and service centers and business\ndirect sales teams also represent significant distribution channels for our\nservices. In addition, we have a robust digital channel and omni-channel as a\npart of the customer experience in order to offer choice and convenience.\n\n  \n\nOur indirect channel includes agents that sell our wireless and wireline\nproducts and services at retail locations throughout the U.S., as well as\nthrough the internet. The majority of these sales are made under exclusive\nselling arrangements with us. We also have relationships with high-profile\nnational retailers that sell our wireless and wireline products and services,\nas well as convenience store chains that sell our wireless prepaid products\nand services.\n\n  \n\nIn addition to our direct channel, our Business segment has additional\ndistribution channels that include business solution fulfillment provided by\nresellers, non-stocked device fulfillment performed by distributors and\nintegrated mobility services provided by system integrators and resellers.\n\n  \n\n| |   \n---|---|---  \nGlobal Networks and Technology  \n  \nOur Networks\n\nWe design, build and operate networks to provide connectivity and related\nservices meeting the needs of our diverse customers: consumers, businesses,\ngovernment organizations and educational institutions.\n\n  \n\n\u2022Technologies - Our networks leverage advanced technologies, including 5G\nwireless, fiber-based transport, cloud infrastructures, private networks and\nIP routing solutions.\n\n  \n\n6\n\n* * *\n\n\u2022Scale and geography - We operate a national network covering over 146 million\nwireless retail connections as of December 31, 2024. In addition to our\nsignificant U.S. infrastructure, we have a presence globally and relationships\nwith many operators and partners allowing us to service multinational network\nneeds.", "\u2022Services and capabilities - We provide connectivity, access to the internet,\nvoice calling, text messaging and both linear and streaming video\ncapabilities. Beyond these basic services, our network solutions include\nadvanced services and capabilities such as E911, first responder solutions and\nprivate networking solutions.\n\n  \n\n\u2022Reliability - We strive to design and deploy reliable networks. We test our\nnetworks for reliability and use various methods and procedures to maintain\nnetwork availability, capability and capacity. To mitigate the impact of power\ndisruptions on our operations, we have battery backup at every switch and\nevery macro cell. We also utilize backup generators at a majority of our macro\ncells and at every switch location. In addition, we have a fleet of portable\nbackup generators that can be deployed if needed.\n\n  \n\nNetwork Evolution\n\nWe consider the reliability, speed, capacity, coverage and security of our\nwireless network to be key factors in our continued success. We are evolving\nand transforming our networks to ensure our customers receive access to the\nbest network possible. Areas of evolution and transformation include:\n\n  \n\n\u20225G Wireless - Verizon has driven the conversion from 4G to 5G through a\nsequence of network changes involving the radio access network, the core\nnetwork infrastructure and change to the devices connecting to the network.\nOver the past several years, we have been leading the development of 5G\nwireless technology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and mobile\n5G wireless services. 5G technology enables higher throughput and lower\nlatency than 4G LTE technology and allows our networks to handle more traffic\nas the number of internet-connected devices and customer usage needs grow. Our\nevolution to 5G with its new architecture allows us to simplify operations by\neliminating legacy network elements.\n\n  \n\n\u2022Coverage and densification - We continue to improve 5G wireless service\ncoverage by leveraging our breadth of wireless spectrum, including millimeter\nwave and C-Band spectrum, which we are continuing to deploy across the\ncontinental U.S. We are densifying our networks by utilizing macro and small\ncell technology, in-building solutions and distributed antenna systems.\nNetwork densification enables us to increase coverage, improve quality of\nservice and add capacity to accommodate an increasing number of users. It also\nsupports our growing FWA business and growing bandwidth needs for uses such as\nstreaming and video content creation.\n\n  \n\n\u2022Virtualization - We are leveraging the benefits of cloud computing and\nstorage as we evolve our network infrastructure. Our private cloud\ninfrastructure allows us to use shared compute, storage and networking\nresources rather than building unique physical instances for our network\ninfrastructure.\n\n  \n\n\u2022Fiber transport and IP networking - We own and operate one of the largest\nglobal fiber-optic networks in the world, providing connectivity to Business\ncustomers in more than 180 countries. Our global IP network includes long-\nhaul, metro and submarine assets that enable and support international\noperations. In response to growing bandwidth demand, we have upgraded and\nincreased our long-haul core fiber-based transport capacity as well as our IP\nnetwork capacity and efficiency. We continue to build local fiber networks by\nadding fiber connectivity to premises, venues, cell tower locations and data\ncenters.\n\n  \n\n\u2022Energy efficiency - We strive to improve the energy efficiency of our\nnetworks, facilities and fleet. We are balancing increased energy needs from\nongoing expansion and densification of our networks with initiatives to\neffectively manage energy consumption, including using more energy-efficient\nequipment, discontinuing or migrating legacy services and pursuing\nopportunities to use renewable energy sources.\n\n  \n\nFios", "Fios\n\nResidential broadband service has seen significant growth in bandwidth demand\nover the past several years, and we believe that demand will continue to grow.\nWe expect that the continued emergence of new video services, new data\napplications and the proliferation of IP devices in the home will continue to\ndrive new network requirements for increased data speeds and throughput. We\nbelieve that the Passive Optical Network (PON) technology underpinning Fios\npositions us well to meet these demands in a cost-effective and efficient\nmanner. We also continue to evolve the in-home broadband router element to\nbring new capability and improved performance, such as improved Wi-Fi, to our\nretail customers.\n\n  \n\nWhile deployed initially as a consumer broadband network, our Fios\ninfrastructure is also experiencing more widespread application in the\nBusiness segment, especially as businesses increasingly migrate to ethernet-\nbased access services.\n\n  \n\nIn September 2024, we entered into an agreement to acquire Frontier\nCommunications Parent, Inc. (Frontier), a U.S. provider of broadband internet\nand other communication services. Upon closing, this transaction is expected\nto enhance our fiber broadband footprint and provide opportunities for future\nFios growth.\n\n7\n\n* * *\n\n  \n\nSpectrum\n\nThe spectrum licenses we hold can be used for mobile and fixed wireless voice,\nvideo and data communications services. We are licensed by the Federal\nCommunications Commission (FCC) to provide these wireless services on the\nfollowing low and mid-band spectrum in areas that collectively cover nearly\nall of the population of the U.S.: (i) the 700 MHz Upper C block, (ii)\nCellular spectrum (850 MHz), (iii) Personal Communication Services (PCS)\nspectrum (1900 MHz), (iv) AWS 1 and AWS 3 bands (1700 MHz uplink and 2100 MHz\ndownlink), and (v) the 3.7 GHz band (C-Band). We also hold spectrum licenses\nin the 28, Upper 37 and 39 GHz bands, known as millimeter wave spectrum, and\nutilize both Priority Access Licenses (PALs) and General Authorized Access\n(GAA) in the 3.5 GHz band (Citizens Broadband Radio Service).\n\n  \n\nWe anticipate that demand for spectrum will continue to increase over time,\ndriven by growth in customer connections and the increased usage of wireless\nbroadband services that use more bandwidth and require faster rates of speed,\nas well as the wider deployment of 5G mobile and fixed services. We expect to\nmeet the demand for 5G and 4G spectrum needs with our existing spectrum\nassets. If demand continues to increase or if new spectrum is required for a\nfuture generation of technology, we can meet that demand by acquiring licenses\nor leasing spectrum from other licensees, or by acquiring new spectrum\nlicenses from the FCC, if and when future FCC spectrum auctions occur.\n\n  \n\nFrom time to time we have exchanged spectrum licenses with other wireless\nservice providers through secondary market swap transactions. We expect to\ncontinue to pursue similar opportunities to trade spectrum licenses in order\nto meet capacity and expansion needs in the future. We also gain access to\nspectrum through cross-lease transactions. In certain cases, we have entered\ninto intra-market spectrum swaps designed to increase the amount of contiguous\nspectrum within frequency bands in a specific market. Contiguous spectrum\nimproves network performance and efficiency. These swaps, as well as any\nspectrum purchases, require us to obtain governmental approvals.\n\n  \n\nInformation regarding spectrum license transactions, including our pending\nacquisition of select spectrum licenses of United States Cellular Corporation\nand certain of its subsidiaries, is presented in Note 3 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements included in this Annual Report.", "| |   \n---|---|---  \nCompetition and Related Trends  \n  \nThe telecommunications industry is highly competitive. The rapid development\nof new technologies, services and products has eliminated many of the\ndistinctions among wireless, cable, internet and traditional telephone\nservices and brought new competitors to our markets. We expect competition to\nremain intense as traditional and non-traditional participants seek increased\nmarket share.\n\n  \n\nCompetitive factors within the telecommunications industry include, among\nothers, network reliability, speed, capacity and coverage; pricing and\npromotional strategies; the quality of customer service; marketing, sales and\ndistribution capabilities; development of new and enhanced products and\nservices; the ability to anticipate and respond to various factors and trends\naffecting our industry; the availability of capital resources; and regulatory\nchanges.\n\n  \n\nCompetition remains intense as a result of various factors, including\naggressive pricing, increased levels of promotions and service plan discounts,\nand offerings that include additional bundled premium content or other perks,\nin some cases specifically targeting Verizon customers. Competition may\nincrease as smaller, stand-alone wireless service providers merge or transfer\nlicenses to larger, better capitalized wireless service providers and as MVNOs\nresell wireless communication services. In addition, aggressive network\ndeployment as well as increasing government incentives related to it may\nenhance the ability of certain of our competitors to compete with us.\n\n  \n\nWith respect to our wireless connectivity products and services, we compete\nagainst other national wireless service providers, including AT&T Inc. and\nT-Mobile US, Inc., as well as various regional wireless service providers. We\nalso compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale\nservice from wireless service providers, including Verizon, and resell it to\ntheir customers. Resellers include cable companies, such as Comcast\nCorporation and Charter Communications, Inc., and others. Several major cable\noperators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic\nrelationships.\n\n  \n\nWe also face competition from other communications and technology companies\nseeking to increase their brand recognition and capture market share with\nrespect to the provision of wireless products and services, in addition to\nnon-traditional offerings in mobile data. For example, Microsoft Corporation,\nAlphabet Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms, Inc. and others are offering\nalternative means for messaging and making wireless voice calls that, in\ncertain cases, can be used in lieu of the wireless providers' voice service,\nas well as alternative means of accessing video content. In addition, we are\nseeing increasing competition in the provisioning of internet access by low\nEarth orbit satellite companies as well in the area of fixed wireless\nofferings that provide an alternative to traditional landline internet service\nproviders.\n\n  \n\nWith respect to Fios and our other broadband services, we compete against\ncable companies, wireless service providers, domestic and foreign\ntelecommunications providers, satellite television companies, low Earth orbit\nsatellite companies, internet service providers, OTT providers and other\ncompanies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions. We\nalso\n\n8\n\n* * *\n\nface increasing competition from other internet portal providers. We expect\nthe market will continue to shift from traditional linear video to OTT\nofferings. We also expect customer migration from traditional voice services\nto wireless services to continue.", "Companies with a global presence are increasingly competing with us in our\nBusiness segment. A relatively small number of telecommunications and\nintegrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the\nglobal enterprise market and, to a lesser extent, the global wholesale market.\nWe compete with these providers for large contracts to provide integrated\nsolutions to global enterprises and government customers. Many of these\ncompanies have strong market presence, brand recognition and existing customer\nrelationships, all of which contribute to intense competition.\n\n  \n\nIn the Enterprise and Public Sector markets, competition levels remain high,\nprimarily as a result of increased industry focus on technology convergence.\nWe compete in this area with system integrators, carriers, and hardware and\nsoftware providers. In addition, some of the largest information technology\nservices companies are making strategic acquisitions, divesting non-strategic\nassets and forging new alliances to improve their cost structure. Many new\nalliances and acquisitions have focused on developing fields, such as cloud\ncomputing, software defined networking, communication applications and other\ncomputing tasks via networks, rather than by the use of in-house machines.\n\n  \n\nIn the Business Markets and Other category, customer purchasing behaviors and\npreferences continue to evolve. Solution speed and simplicity are becoming key\ndifferentiators for customers who are seeking full life-cycle offers that\nsimplify the process of starting, running and growing their businesses. Mobile\nnetwork operators and other carriers are aggressively targeting this customer\ngroup with a variety of bundles and discounts as it is among the largest and\nfastest growing categories in the Business segment.\n\n  \n\nOur Wholesale business competes with traditional carriers for metro/mid/long-\nhaul fiber, voice and IP services. In addition, mobile video and data needs\nare driving a greater need for wireless backhaul. Network providers, cable\ncompanies and specialty firms are competitors for this business opportunity.\n\n  \n\n| |   \n---|---|---  \nRegulatory Trends  \n  \nRegulatory Landscape\n\nVerizon operates in a regulated and highly competitive market, as described\nabove. Some of our competitors are subject to fewer regulatory constraints\nthan Verizon. For many services offered by Verizon, the FCC is our primary\nregulator. The FCC has jurisdiction over interstate telecommunications\nservices and other matters under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended\n(Communications Act). Other Verizon services are subject to various state and\nlocal regulations.\n\n  \n\nFederal, State and Local Regulation\n\nWireless Services\n\nThe FCC regulates several aspects of our wireless operations. Generally, the\nFCC has jurisdiction over the construction, operation, acquisition and\ntransfer of wireless communications systems. All wireless services require use\nof radio frequency spectrum, the assignment and distribution of which is\nsubject to FCC oversight. If demand continues to increase or if new spectrum\nis required for a future generation of technology, we can meet our needs for\nlicensed spectrum by purchasing licenses or leasing spectrum from others, or\nby participating in a competitive bidding process to acquire new spectrum from\nthe FCC. Those processes are subject to certain reviews, approvals and\npotential conditions.", "Today, Verizon holds FCC spectrum licenses that allow it to provide a wide\nrange of mobile and fixed communications services, including both voice and\ndata services. FCC spectrum licenses typically have a term of 10 years, at\nwhich time they are subject to renewal. While the FCC has routinely renewed\nall of Verizon's wireless licenses, challenges could be raised in the future.\nIf a wireless license was revoked or not renewed, Verizon would not be\npermitted to provide services on the spectrum covered by that license. Some of\nour licenses require us to comply with so-called \"open access\" FCC\nregulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow\ncustomers to use devices and applications of their choice, subject to certain\ntechnical limitations. The FCC has also imposed certain specific mandates on\nwireless carriers, including construction and geographic coverage\nrequirements, technical operating standards, provision of enhanced 911\nservices, roaming obligations and requirements for wireless tower and antenna\nfacilities.\n\n  \n\nThe Communications Act generally preempts regulation by state and local\ngovernments of the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless carriers. It\ndoes not prohibit states from regulating the other \"terms and conditions\" of\nwireless service. For example, some states impose reporting and consumer\nprotection requirements. Several states also have laws or regulations that\naddress safety issues (for example, use of wireless handsets while driving),\nuniversal service funding, and taxation matters. Some states are also\nconsidering new network reliability or service quality requirements that may\naffect how and where we provide services if not preempted by federal law. In\naddition, wireless tower and antenna facilities are often subject to state and\nlocal zoning and land use regulation, and securing approvals for new or\nmodified facilities is often a lengthy and expensive process.\n\n  \n\n9\n\n* * *\n\nBroadband\n\nVerizon offers many different broadband services. In early January 2025, based\non litigation filed by the broadband industry, a federal appeals court\noverturned the FCC's April 2024 final decision to regulate broadband services\nvia utility-style common carriage regulation under Title II of the\nCommunications Act. Absent further action in the courts, this decision will\nremain in effect and limit the risk of burdensome FCC broadband regulation. In\naddition to federal activity, several states have adopted or are considering\nadopting laws or executive orders that would impose net neutrality and other\nrequirements on some of our broadband services, including a law in New York\nthat requires discounted broadband pricing for low income customers. Some\nstates may also impose pricing or other rules related to broadband built with\nthe assistance of federal or state funding. The FCC also adopted broad rules\nrelated to \"digital discrimination\" that could further increase regulatory\noversight of broadband services; industry groups have appealed those rules in\ncourt. Our broadband commitment can be found on our website at\nhttps://www.verizon.com/about/our-company/verizon-broadband-commitment.\n\n  \n\nWireline Voice\n\nVerizon offers many different wireline voice services, including traditional\ntelephone service and other services that rely on technologies such as VoIP.\nFor regulatory purposes, legacy telephone services are generally considered to\nbe \"common carrier\" services. Common carrier services are subject to\nheightened regulatory oversight with respect to rates, terms and conditions\nand other aspects of the services. The FCC has not decided the regulatory\nclassification of VoIP but has said VoIP service providers must comply with\ncertain rules, such as 911 capabilities and law enforcement assistance\nrequirements.", "State public utility commissions regulate Verizon's telephone operations with\nrespect to certain telecommunications intrastate matters. Verizon operates as\nan \"incumbent local exchange carrier\" in nine states and the District of\nColumbia. These incumbent operations are subject to various levels of pricing\nflexibility and other state oversight and requirements. Verizon also has other\nwireline operations that are more lightly regulated. Some states, including\nCalifornia, impose reporting requirements and are considering new network\nreliability or service quality requirements for wireline voice services,\nincluding for VoIP.\n\n  \n\nVideo\n\nVerizon offers a multichannel video service that is regulated like traditional\ncable service. The FCC has a body of rules that apply to cable operators, and\nthese rules also generally apply to Verizon. In areas where Verizon offers its\nfacilities-based multichannel video services, Verizon has been required to\nobtain a cable franchise from local government entities, or in some cases a\nstate-wide franchise, and comply with certain one-time and ongoing obligations\nas a result.\n\n  \n\nPrivacy, Data Protection, and Artificial Intelligence\n\nWe are subject to local, state, federal, and international laws and\nregulations relating to privacy and data protection that impact all parts of\nour business, including wireline, wireless, broadband and the development and\nroll out of new products. At the federal level, our business is governed by\nthe FCC or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), depending on the product or\nservice. The California Consumer Privacy Act, Europe's General Data Protection\nRegulation and a number of other privacy laws more recently adopted by other\nstates and countries include significant penalties for non-compliance.\nGenerally, attention to privacy and data security requirements is increasing\nat all levels of government globally, and privacy-related legislation has been\nintroduced or is under consideration in many locations. These regulations\ncould have a significant impact on our businesses. Policymakers at the local,\nstate, federal and international levels are also considering imposing laws and\nregulations on the use of artificial intelligence (AI). This is a nascent area\nof regulatory focus; therefore, it is unclear how such regulation could impact\nour business.\n\n  \n\nPublic Safety and Cybersecurity\n\nThe FCC plays a role in addressing public safety concerns by regulating\nemergency communications services and mandating widespread availability of\nboth media (broadcast/cable) and wireless emergency alerting services. In\naddition, federal and state agencies have mandated and may impose additional\nregulations to ensure continuity of service during disasters. For example, the\nFCC adopted rules requiring wireless providers to support roaming on each\nother's networks during disasters, and the California Public Utilities\nCommission has imposed regulations relating to back-up power for\ncommunications facilities. In response to prior cyberattacks and increasing\nrisks from cybersecurity threats, the FCC and other regulators are attempting\nto increase regulation of the cybersecurity practices of providers. The FCC is\nalso addressing the use by American companies of equipment produced by certain\ncompanies deemed to cause potential national security risks. Verizon does not\ncurrently use equipment in its networks from vendors under such restrictions.\n\n  \n\nIntercarrier Compensation and Network Access\n\nThe FCC regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the\nexchange of voice traffic (particularly traditional wireline traffic) over\ndifferent networks and other aspects of interconnection for some voice\nservices. The FCC also regulates some of the rates and terms and conditions\nfor certain wireline \"business data services\" and other services and network\nfacilities. Verizon is both a seller and a buyer of these services, and both\nmakes and receives interconnection payments.\n\n  \n\n10\n\n* * *", "10\n\n* * *\n\n| |   \n---|---|---  \nHuman Capital Resources  \n  \nWith approximately 99,600 employees on a full-time equivalent basis as of\nDecember 31, 2024, 88% of whom are based in the U.S., we know that our people\nare one of our most valuable investments. In order to realize our core\nbusiness strategy, we have developed human capital programs and practices that\nsupport, develop and care for our employees throughout their careers with\nVerizon. Our strategy to build a workforce with talent, skills and motivation\nto give the company a competitive edge now and into the future rests on three\npillars:\n\n  \n\n\u2022Attract and maintain a diverse workforce with the necessary skills and talent\nto execute on our business priorities.\n\n  \n\n\u2022Develop our employees' potential by offering educational opportunities that\nkeep pace with changes occurring across our industry.\n\n  \n\n\u2022Inspire individuals to build a career at Verizon by providing meaningful work\nand opportunities for career advancement in a collaborative and inclusive\nenvironment.\n\n  \n\nVerizon strives to be an employer of choice by offering our employees\ncompetitive compensation and benefits packages.

People of color represented 34.0% of U.S.\nsenior leadership.\n\n  \n\nVerizon respects our employees' rights to freedom of association and\ncollective bargaining in compliance with applicable laws, including the right\nto join or not join labor unions. We have a long history of working with the\nCommunications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of\nElectrical Workers -- the two unions that in total represent approximately 25%\nof our employees as of December 31, 2024. The current collective bargaining\nagreements covering our union-represented employees who serve customers in our\nMid-Atlantic and Northeast service areas extend through August 1, 2026. Other\ncollective bargaining agreements covering smaller groups of employees extend\nthrough various dates between 2025 and 2028. In addition, where applicable\noutside of the U.S., we engage with employee representative bodies such as\nworks council. Verizon meets with U.S. national and local union leaders, as\nwell as works council leaders outside the U.S., to talk about key business\ntopics, including safety, customer service, plans to improve operational\nprocesses, our business performance and the impacts that changing technology\nand competition are having on our customers, employees and business strategy.\n\n  \n\nFor a discussion of Verizon's Board oversight of risks related to our human\ncapital resources, see the section entitled \"Governance -- Our governance\nframework -- Oversight of business risks\" in our definitive Proxy Statement to\nbe filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and delivered to\nshareholders in connection with our 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.", "| |   \n---|---|---  \nPatents, Trademarks and Licenses  \n  \nWe own or have licenses to various patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain\nnames and other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our\nbusiness.

Risk Factors  \n  \nThe following discussion of \"Risk Factors\" identifies factors that may\nadversely affect our business, operations, financial condition or future\nperformance. This information should be read in conjunction with \"Management's\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations\" and\nthe consolidated financial statements and related notes. The following\ndiscussion of risks is not all-inclusive but is designed to highlight what we\nbelieve are the material factors to consider when evaluating our business and\nexpectations. These factors could cause our future results to differ\nmaterially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in\nforward-looking statements.\n\n  \n\n| |   \n---|---|---  \nEconomic and Strategic Risks  \n  \nWe face significant competition that may negatively affect our operating\nresults.\n\nWe face significant competition in our industries. The rapid development of\nnew technologies, services and products has eliminated many of the traditional\ndistinctions among wireless, cable, internet and other communication services\nand brought new competitors to our markets, including other telecommunications\ncompanies, cable companies, wireless service providers, satellite providers,\ntechnology companies and application and device providers. While these changes\nhave enabled us to offer new types of products and services, they have also\nallowed other providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive\nofferings. If we are unable to successfully differentiate our services and\nproducts from our competitors, it could adversely affect our competitive\nposition and market share.\n\n  \n\nOur competitors commonly offer aggressive pricing, promotions, premium content\noptions and other incentives - in some cases specifically targeting our\ncustomers and putting pressure on our pricing and margins. In addition, we\nexpect the wireless industry's customer growth rate to moderate over time in\ncomparison to historical growth rates, leading to increased competition for\ncustomers. Our ability to compete effectively will depend on, among other\nthings, our network reliability, speed, capacity and coverage, the pricing of\nour products and services, our and our competitors' promotional strategies,\nthe quality of our customer service, our development of new and enhanced\nproducts and services, the reach and quality of our sales and distribution\nchannels, our ability to market our products and services effectively and our\ncapital resources. It will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and\nrespond to various factors affecting our industries, including regulatory\nchanges, new technologies and business models, such as the increasing use of\nAI and machine learning technologies, changes in consumer preferences and\ndemand for existing services, demographic trends and evolving geopolitical and\neconomic conditions, including inflation. If we are not able to respond\nsuccessfully to these competitive challenges, our results of operations and\nfinancial condition could be adversely impacted. In addition, a sustained\ndecline in a reporting unit's revenues and earnings has resulted in the past,\nand may again result in the future, in a significant negative impact on its\nfair value requiring us to record an impairment charge, which could have an\nadverse impact on our results of operations.\n\n  \n\nIf we are not able to take advantage of developments in technology and address\nchanging consumer demand on a timely basis, or if the ongoing deployment of\nour 5G network is delayed or hindered for any reason, we may experience a\ndecline in the demand for our services, be unable to implement our business\nstrategy and experience reduced profits.", "Our industries are rapidly changing as new technologies are developed that\noffer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs and allow\nnew entrants into the markets we serve. In order to grow and remain\ncompetitive, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology, enhance\nour existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers'\nchanging demands. If we are unable to meet future challenges from competing\ntechnologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, we could lose\ncustomers to our competitors. We may not be able to accurately predict\ntechnological trends or the success of new services in the market. If our new\nservices fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace, or if costs associated\n\n13\n\n* * *\n\nwith the implementation and introduction of these services materially\nincrease, our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely\naffected.\n\n  \n\nThe deployment of our 5G network is subject to a variety of risks, including\nthose related to equipment availability, unexpected costs, and regulatory\nmatters that could cause deployment delays or network performance issues. In\naddition, certain advanced use cases for 5G technologies and related\necosystems are still in the early phases of adoption and their ultimate\nadoption or success is uncertain. These issues could result in significant\ncosts, put us at a competitive disadvantage, or reduce the anticipated\nbenefits of the enhancements to our networks.\n\n  \n\nAs we introduce new offerings and technologies, we expect to phase out\noutdated and unprofitable technologies and services. If we are unable to do so\non a cost-effective basis, we could experience reduced profits. In addition,\nthere could be legal or regulatory restraints on our ability to phase out\ncurrent services.\n\n  \n\nFinally, we are using AI in our network deployment and maintenance as well as\nour customer and employee support services. There are technological,\nregulatory, ethical and other risks involved in deploying and using AI,\nparticularly generative AI models. There can be no assurance that the usage of\nAI will meaningfully enhance our products or services or be beneficial to our\nbusiness, including our efficiency or profitability. Our investments in AI and\nrelated technologies may not result in the benefits we anticipate or enable us\nto obtain or maintain a competitive advantage.\n\n  \n\nAdverse conditions in the U.S. and international economies could impact our\nresults of operations and financial condition.\n\nUnfavorable economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in\nthe U.S. or elsewhere, or inflation in the markets in which we operate, could\nnegatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and\nservices and our cost of doing business. In difficult economic conditions,\nconsumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of\nour products, electing to use fewer higher margin services, dropping down in\nprice plans or obtaining lower-cost products and services offered by other\ncompanies. Similarly, under these conditions, business customers may delay\npurchasing decisions, or full implementation of our service offerings, reduce\ntheir use of our services or choose lower-cost offerings from our competitors.\nIn addition, adverse economic conditions may lead to an increased number of\nour consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services.\nUnfavorable economic conditions could also amplify other risks discussed in\nthis report, including, but not limited to, those related to our competitive\nposition and margins. Furthermore, our initiatives designed to reduce costs\nand improve operating efficiencies may be ineffective or insufficient.", "Over the last several years, as a result of the inflationary environment in\nthe U.S., we experienced increases in our direct costs, including electricity\nand other energy-related costs for our network operations, and transportation\nand labor costs, as well as increased interest expense related to changing\ninterest rates. In 2022, these factors, along with impacts of the intense\ncompetition in our industries, resulted in lower earnings per share and caused\nus to lower our growth expectations and related financial guidance for that\nyear. Similarly, unfavorable economic conditions in the future could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n  \n\n| |   \n---|---|---  \nOperational Risks  \n  \nCyberattacks impacting our networks or systems could have an adverse effect on\nour business.\n\nCyberattacks, including through the use of ransomware and other forms of\nmalware, distributed denial of services attacks, credential harvesting, social\nengineering and other means for obtaining unauthorized access to or disrupting\nthe operation of our networks and systems and those of our suppliers, vendors\nand other service providers, could have an adverse effect on our business.\nCyberattacks against companies, including Verizon, have increased in\nfrequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. Cyberattacks may be\nperpetrated by a variety of groups or persons, including nation-state and\nstate-sponsored actors, malicious actors, employees, contractors, or other\nunrelated third parties. Nation-state and state-sponsored actors can sustain\nmalicious activities for extended periods and deploy significant resources to\nplan and carry out attacks. For example, in September 2024, we became aware\nthat we were one of several telecommunications companies that were the subject\nof a cyberattack by a highly sophisticated nation-state actor known as Salt\nTyphoon. In that case, the threat actor was able to access portions of our\nnetwork as part of what we determined to be a narrowly focused effort to\nobtain information about a limited number of individuals primarily involved in\ngovernment or political activity. While we were able to contain the Salt\nTyphoon attack, we may be unable to contain or mitigate the impacts of a\nsignificant cyberattack in the future.\n\n  \n\nCyberattacks may cause equipment failures, loss of information, including\nsensitive personal information of customers or employees or valuable\ntechnical, financial and marketing information. Such attacks may also result\nin disruptions to our customers' operations or our own business operations,\nincluding our ability to operate our networks and systems, activate customers\nor take payments. Cyberattacks may occur alone or in conjunction with physical\nattacks, especially where disruption of service is an objective of the\nattacker. Further, the use of AI and machine learning by threat actors may\nincrease the frequency and severity of cyberattacks against us or other\ncompanies. The inability to operate or use our networks and systems or those\nof our suppliers, vendors and other service providers as a result of\ncyberattacks, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant\nexpenses to Verizon, a loss of current or future customers and/or a loss of\nmarket share to our competitors. The costs associated with a cyberattack on\nVerizon could include expensive incentives offered to existing customers and\nbusiness partners\n\n14\n\n* * *", "14\n\n* * *\n\nto retain their business, increased expenditures on cybersecurity measures and\nthe use of alternate resources, lost revenues from business interruption and\nthe costs of investigations and litigation, including potential damages.\nFurther, certain of Verizon's businesses, such as those offering security\nsolutions and infrastructure and cloud services to business customers, could\nbe negatively affected if our ability to protect our own networks and systems\nis called into question as a result of a cyberattack. Our presence in the IoT\nindustry, which includes offerings of telematics products and services, could\nalso increase our exposure to potential costs and expenses and reputational\nharm in the event of cyberattacks impacting these products or services. Any of\nthese occurrences could damage our reputation, adversely impact customer and\ninvestor confidence and result in a material adverse effect on Verizon's\nresults of operation or financial condition.\n\n  \n\nThe development and maintenance of systems to prevent and detect cyberattacks\nis costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating to address the\nincreasing prevalence and sophistication of cyberattacks. In addition, due to\nthe sophistication of threat actors, an attack may persist for an extended\nperiod of time before it is detected, and it may be difficult and time\nconsuming to ascertain the extent of an attack once detected.\n\n  \n\nWhile none of the cyberattacks to which we have been subject to date have been\nmaterial to Verizon's operations or financial condition, there can be no\nguarantee that we will not experience a material cyberattack in the future.\nThe actions we take to reduce the risks associated with cyberattacks,\nincluding protecting our systems and networks, may be insufficient to repel or\nmitigate the effects of a cyberattack in the future.\n\n  \n\nNatural disasters, extreme weather conditions, acts of war, terrorist or other\nhostile acts could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in\nsignificant disruptions to our operations.\n\nOur business operations are subject to interruption by power outages, acts of\nwar, terrorist or other hostile acts, natural disasters or the potential\nimpacts of climate change, including the increasing prevalence and intensity\nof hurricanes, wildfires, flooding, hail and storms. Such events could cause\nsignificant damage to our infrastructure upon which our business operations\nrely, resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our customers, as\nwell as significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. Our\nsystem redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate to sustain our operations\nthrough all such events. We are implementing, and will continue to implement,\nmeasures to protect our infrastructure and operations from the impacts of\nthese events in the future, but these measures and our overall disaster\nrecovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. These events\ncould also damage the infrastructure of the suppliers that provide us with the\nequipment and services that we need to operate our business and provide\nproducts to our customers. These occurrences could result in lost revenues\nfrom business interruption, damage to our reputation and reduced profits.\n\n  \n\nWe depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide services and equipment that\nwe need to operate our business.\n\nWe depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us, directly or\nthrough other suppliers, with equipment and services, such as fiber, switch\nand network equipment, smartphones and other wireless devices, customer\nservice support and other services that we need in order to operate our\nbusiness. For example, our smartphone and other device suppliers often rely on\none vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components, such as\nchipsets, used in their devices, and there are a limited number of companies\ncapable of supplying the network infrastructure equipment on which we depend.", "Our suppliers or vendors could fail to provide equipment or service on a\ntimely basis, or fail to meet our performance expectations, for a number of\nreasons, including, for example, disruption to the global supply chain as a\nresult of geopolitical factors, public health crises, natural disasters or the\npotential impacts of global climate change. If such failures occur, we may be\nunable to provide products and services as and when requested by our\ncustomers, or we may be unable to continue to maintain or upgrade our\nnetworks. Due to the cost and time lag that can be associated with\ntransitioning from one supplier to another, our business could be\nsubstantially disrupted if we were required to, or chose to, replace the\nproducts or services of one or more major suppliers with products or services\nfrom another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on short\nnotice. Any such disruption could increase our costs, decrease our operating\nefficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations and financial condition.\n\n  \n\nA significant number of our suppliers and vendors are located or rely on\noperations outside of the U.S., which carries additional risks and regulatory\nobligations, including those related to cybersecurity, data privacy and\ncompliance. Certain business practices in foreign countries may not align with\nU.S. laws and regulations. In addition, international operations increase our\nexposure to other risks, such as economic and geopolitical instability,\nfluctuations in exchange rates, and labor-related risks.\n\n  \n\nThe suppliers and vendors on which we rely are and may in the future be\nsubject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend, including\nlitigation involving claims of patent infringement. Such claims are frequently\nmade in the communications industry. We are unable to predict whether our\nbusiness will be affected by any such litigation. We expect our dependence on\nkey suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced\ngenerations of technology.\n\n  \n\n15\n\n* * *\n\nA significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions, and we\ncould incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the\nrenegotiation of our labor contracts.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, approximately 25% of our workforce is represented by\nthe Communications Workers of America or the International Brotherhood of\nElectrical Workers. While we have labor contracts in place with these unions,\nwith subsequent negotiations we could incur additional costs and/or experience\nwork stoppages, which could adversely affect our business operations. In\naddition, while a small percentage of the workforce outside of our traditional\nwireline operations is represented by unions for bargaining, we cannot predict\nwhat impact increased union density in this workforce could have on our\noperations.\n\n  \n\nDamage to our reputation or brands could adversely affect our business.\n\nWe believe that our reputation and brands significantly contribute to the\nsuccess of our business and our relationships with our customers, employees\nand other stakeholders.", "We believe that our reputation and brands significantly contribute to the\nsuccess of our business and our relationships with our customers, employees\nand other stakeholders.\n\n  \n\nOur reputation and brands could be negatively affected by a number of factors,\nincluding actual or alleged quality or reliability issues related to our\nservices and products; cybersecurity incidents and data breaches; allegations\nof legal noncompliance; litigation or regulatory activity; incidents involving\nunethical behavior or misconduct; material weaknesses in our internal controls\nover financial reporting; safety, human rights, workplace or labor issues;\nenvironmental incidents or impacts; allegations related to the safety of our\nproducts, services and equipment; governance issues; our sustainability goals\nand practices; our actual or perceived position or lack of position on social\nand other sensitive matters; the conduct of our employees, representatives or\npartners; activists' campaigns; negative sentiment about us shared over social\nmedia or the press; and other issues, incidents, or statements that, whether\nbased on actual or perceived circumstances, result in adverse publicity. In\naddition, changes to the content standards of social media platforms could\nimpact our marketing and advertising initiatives on such platforms and\nincrease risks related to our brand.\n\n  \n\nDamage to our reputation and brands could undermine our customers' confidence\nin us and reduce demand for our products and services, which could result in\ndecreased revenue and adversely affect our business and financial results. If\nour reputation or brands are damaged, it could also attract regulatory\nscrutiny, increase litigation risks, affect our ability to attract and retain\ntop talent, and reduce investor confidence in us.\n\n  \n\nPublic health crises could materially adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\n\nWe are subject to risks related to public health crises, which have in the\npast, and may in the future, have an adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition and operating results. For example, in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic\nand resulting policies, initiatives and impacts, along with the related global\nslowdown in economic activity, resulted in our decreased revenues, increased\ncosts and lower earnings per share. Negative effects of a public health crisis\nmay include, but are not limited to, closure of our retail stores, impacts on\ncustomers' use of our networks, products and services and their ability to pay\nfor them, employees' health and safety concerns, limitation of customer-\nfocused field operations, and vendor and supply chain disruptions. In\naddition, such a crisis could significantly increase the probability or\nconsequences of the risks our business faces in ordinary circumstances, such\nas risks associated with our supplier and vendor relationships, risks of an\neconomic slowdown, regulatory risks, and the costs and availability of\nfinancing.\n\n  \n\n| |   \n---|---|---  \nRegulatory and Legal Risks  \n  \nChanges in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely\naffect our business prospects or results of operations.", "| |   \n---|---|---  \nRegulatory and Legal Risks  \n  \nChanges in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely\naffect our business prospects or results of operations.\n\nOur domestic operations are subject to regulation by the FCC and other\nfederal, state, and local agencies, and our international operations are\nregulated by various foreign governments and international bodies. These\nregulatory regimes frequently restrict or impose conditions on our ability to\noperate in designated areas and provide specified products or services. We are\nfrequently required to maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our\noperations in accordance with prescribed standards. We are often involved in\nregulatory and other governmental proceedings or inquiries related to the\napplication of these requirements. It is impossible to predict with any\ncertainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings\nrelating to our operations, or the reviews by federal or state courts of\nregulatory rulings. Without relief, existing laws and regulations may inhibit\nour ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services.\nSimilarly, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining the\nlicenses needed to carry out our business plan or in maintaining our existing\nlicenses. For example, the FCC grants wireless licenses for terms generally\nlasting 10 years, subject to renewal. The loss of, or a material limitation\non, certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n  \n\nNew laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the\nfederal, state, and local, or international level, such as those described\nbelow, those that incentivize business models or technologies different from\nours or requirements limiting our ability to continue or discontinue service\nto customers could restrict the ways in which we manage our wireline and\nwireless networks and operate our businesses, impose additional costs,\ndiminish revenue opportunities, and potentially impede our ability to provide\nservices in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers.\n\n  \n\n16\n\n* * *\n\n\u2022Privacy and data protection - We are subject to local, state, federal and\ninternational laws and regulations related to privacy and data protection. In\nparticular, the California Consumer Privacy Act, Europe's General Data\nProtection Regulation and a number of other privacy laws more recently adopted\nby other states and countries include significant penalties for non-\ncompliance. Generally, attention to privacy and data security requirements is\nincreasing at all levels of government globally, and privacy-related\nlegislation has been introduced or is under consideration in many locations.\nThese regulations could have a significant impact on our businesses.", "\u2022Regulation of broadband internet access services - Verizon offers many\ndifferent broadband services. In early January 2025, based on litigation filed\nby the broadband industry, a federal appeals court overturned the FCC's April\n2024 final decision to regulate broadband services via utility-style common\ncarriage regulation under Title II of the Communications Act. Absent further\naction in the courts, this decision will remain in effect and limit the risk\nof burdensome FCC broadband regulation. In addition to federal activity,\nseveral states have adopted or are considering adopting laws or executive\norders that would impose net neutrality and other requirements on some of our\nbroadband services, including a law in New York that requires discounted\nbroadband pricing for low income customers. Some states may also impose\npricing or other rules related to broadband built with the assistance of\nfederal or state funding. The FCC also adopted broad rules related to \"digital\ndiscrimination\" that could further increase regulatory oversight of broadband\nservices; industry groups have appealed those rules in court.\n\n  \n\n\u2022\"Open access\" - We hold certain wireless licenses that require us to comply\nwith so-called \"open access\" FCC regulations, which generally require\nlicensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and\napplications of their choice. Moreover, certain services could be subject to\nconflicting regulation by the FCC and/or various state and local authorities,\nwhich could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing\nnew services.\n\n  \n\n\u2022Climate-related regulation and policy - Due to the nature of our operations,\nwe have been, and expect to continue to be impacted by regulatory developments\nrelated to climate change, including, for example, the direct regulation of\ngreenhouse gas emissions or carbon policies that could result in a tax on such\nemissions. In addition, policy-driven changes in the prices of fuel or energy\nin geographies in which we operate could make it more expensive for us to\npurchase energy to power our networks and data centers, and any increase in\ntaxes on fuel could increase our costs associated with operating those\nvehicles in our fleet that are dependent on traditional fuels.\n\n  \n\nThese developments and the further regulation of broadband, wireless, and our\nother activities and any related court decisions could result in significant\nincreases in costs for us or restrict our ability to compete in the\nmarketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future\ninvestments in our networks.\n\n  \n\nOur business may be impacted by changes in tax laws and regulations, or their\ninterpretations, and challenges to our tax positions.\n\nTax laws and regulations are complex, dynamic, and subject to change and\nvarying interpretations, especially when evaluated against new technologies\nand telecommunications services. In addition, tax legislation has been\nintroduced or is being considered in various jurisdictions that could\nsignificantly impact our tax rate, tax liabilities, and the carrying value of\ndeferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities. Any of these changes could\nmaterially impact our financial performance and our tax provision, net income\nand cash flows.", "We are also subject to ongoing audits, examinations and other tax\ncontroversies in various jurisdictions. Although we regularly assess the\nlikelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these controversies to\ndetermine the adequacy of provisions for taxes, the final outcome of any such\ncontroversy may be materially different from our expectations. In the event\nthat we have not accurately or fully described, disclosed or determined,\ncalculated or remitted amounts that were due to taxing authorities or if the\nultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts\npreviously accrued, we could be subject to additional taxes, penalties and\ninterest, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and\noperating results.\n\n  \n\nWe are subject to a substantial amount of litigation, which could require us\nto pay significant damages or settlements.\n\nWe are subject to a substantial amount of litigation and claims in\narbitration, including, but not limited to, shareholder lawsuits, patent and\ncopyright infringement lawsuits, wage and hour class actions, contract and\ncommercial claims, personal injury claims, property claims, environmental\nclaims, and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and\ncollection practices. We may incur significant expenses in defending these\nlawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay significant awards of damages\nor settlements. We also could be subject to court-ordered injunctions and\nother remedies that could negatively impact our business operations. Our\nwireless business is also subject to lawsuits relating to alleged adverse\nhealth effects of wireless phones and radio frequency transmitters. Any of\nthese allegations or changes in government agencies' assessment of the risks\nassociated with using wireless devices could result in significant legal and\nregulatory liability and other remedies, and could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\n  \n\n17\n\n* * *\n\nAllegations related to lead sheathed copper cables in our copper network\ninfrastructure could expose us to regulatory scrutiny, litigation, penalties,\nremoval and compliance costs, operational impact or reputational damage.\n\nThere have been media reports alleging that certain lead sheathed copper\ncables that are part of our copper-based network infrastructure may present\nhealth or environmental risks in areas where those facilities are deployed.\nThese allegations have resulted in government investigations, regulatory\ninquiries and litigation, and could further result in legislative or\nregulatory actions, penalties and other liability, remediation and compliance\ncosts or negative operational impacts. Additional legal proceedings and other\ncontingencies may arise in the future. Our insurance policies may not cover or\nmay not be sufficient to fully cover the costs of these claims. Accordingly,\nwe may incur substantial expenses as a result of these allegations, which\ncannot be reasonably estimated at this time but could be material.\n\n  \n\nIn addition, negative assertions about the health or environmental impact of\nour lead sheathed cables may harm our reputation, which could adversely affect\nour business and our relationship with various stakeholders, even if such\nallegations ultimately prove to be inaccurate.\n\n  \n\n| |   \n---|---|---  \nFinancial Risks  \n  \nVerizon has significant debt, which could increase further if we incur\nadditional debt in the future and do not retire existing debt.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, Verizon had approximately $117.9 billion of\noutstanding unsecured indebtedness, $12.0 billion of unused borrowing capacity\nunder our existing revolving credit facility and $26.1 billion of outstanding\nsecured indebtedness. Our debt level and related debt service obligations\ncould have negative consequences, including:", "\u2022requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment\nof principal, interest and other amounts payable on our debt, which would\nreduce the funds we have available for other purposes, such as working\ncapital, capital expenditures, dividend payments and acquisitions;\n\n  \n\n\u2022making it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain any necessary future\nfinancing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service\nrequirements, debt refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes and limiting\nour ability to repurchase common stock;\n\n  \n\n\u2022reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our\nindustries and market conditions;\n\n  \n\n\u2022making us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business; and\n\n  \n\n\u2022exposing us to increased interest rate risk to the extent that (i) our debt\nobligations are subject to variable interest rates or (ii) we need to\nrefinance existing debt that bears interest at a rate lower than current\nmarket rates.\n\n  \n\nOur initiatives aimed at reducing our indebtedness and achieving any target\nleverage ratio may be unsuccessful due to macroeconomic, business and other\nfactors.\n\n  \n\nAdverse changes in the financial markets and other factors could increase our\nborrowing costs and reduce the availability of financing.\n\nWe require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business.\nWe fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private\ncredit markets. Adverse changes in the financial markets, including increases\nin interest rates or changes in exchange rates, could increase our cost of\nborrowing, require us to post a significant amount of collateral, and/or make\nit more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or refinance\nexisting indebtedness. In addition, our ability to obtain funding under asset-\nbacked debt transactions is subject to our ability to continue to originate a\nsufficient amount of assets eligible to be securitized. Our borrowing costs\nalso can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by\nindependent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on our\nperformance as measured by customary credit metrics. A decrease in these\nratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more\ndifficult for us to obtain financing. A severe disruption in the global\nfinancial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which\nwe do business, and such instability could also affect our access to\nfinancing.\n\n  \n\nIncreases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare\nbenefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments.\n\nWith approximately 99,600 employees and approximately 179,700 retirees as of\nDecember 31, 2024 eligible to participate in Verizon's benefit plans, the\ncosts of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a\nsignificant impact on our profitability. Our costs of maintaining these plans,\nand the future funding requirements for these plans, are affected by several\nfactors, including increases in healthcare costs, decreases in investment\nreturns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes\nin the discount rate and mortality assumptions used to calculate pension and\nother postretirement\n\n18\n\n* * *\n\nexpenses. If we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our\nbenefit plans, those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our\nfunding commitments.\n\n  \n\nWe are subject to risks associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures\nand other strategic transactions.", "We are subject to risks associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures\nand other strategic transactions.\n\nFrom time to time, we pursue mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, assets\ntransfers and other strategic transactions that we believe may expand our\nbusiness or are consistent with our strategy.

We are evolving\nand transforming our networks to ensure our customers receive access to the\nbest network possible. Over the past several years, we have been leading the\ndevelopment of 5G wireless technology industry standards and the ecosystems\nfor fixed and mobile 5G wireless services. Our evolution to 5G with its new\narchitecture allows us to simplify operations by eliminating legacy network\nelements.\n\n  \n\nWhile we continue to improve our 5G wireless service coverage, we are also\nadding capacity and density to our networks. Network densification enables us\nto increase coverage, improve quality of service and add capacity to\naccommodate an increasing number of users.\n\n  \n\nIn addition to enhancing our wireless service, our wireless mobility\ninvestments provide the foundation for our growing FWA broadband business. We\nare also continuing to expand our fiber-based networks, as customers\nincreasingly value the ability to obtain wireless and wireline broadband\nservices from the same provider. In September 2024, we entered into an\nagreement to acquire Frontier as part of our fiber expansion strategy, and we\nexpect to increase the capital expenditures we devote to our fiber networks in\n2025.\n\n  \n\n| |   \n---|---|---  \nConsolidated Results of Operations  \n  \nIn this section, we discuss our overall results of operations and highlight\nspecial items that are not included in our segment results.

The decrease of $991 million in\nrestricted cash was primarily due to a change in the timing on when cash\ncollections on certain receivables collateralizing our asset-backed debt\nsecurities are required to be placed into segregated accounts.\n\n  \n\nFree Cash Flow\n\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that reflects an additional way\nof viewing our liquidity that, we believe, when viewed with our GAAP results,\nprovides management, investors and other users of our financial information\nwith a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash\nflows. Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures\n(including capitalized software) from net cash provided by operating\nactivities. We believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flow since\ncapital expenditures are necessary for ongoing operations. Free cash flow has\nlimitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow\navailable for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not\nincorporate payments made on finance lease obligations or cash payments for\nbusiness acquisitions or wireless licenses. Therefore, we believe it is\nimportant to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated\nstatements of cash flows.\n\n  \n\nThe following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to\nfree cash flow:\n\n| | | | | | | | | | | | |   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n| (dollars in millions)| |   \nYears Ended December 31,| 2024| | 2023| |   \nNet cash provided by operating activities| $| 36,912 | | | $| 37,475 | | |   \nLess Capital expenditures (including capitalized software)| 17,090 | | | 18,767 | | |   \nFree cash flow| $| 19,822 | | | $| 18,708 | | |   \n  \n  \n\nThe increase in free cash flow during 2024 is a reflection of the decrease in\ncapital expenditures, partially offset by the decrease in operating cash\nflows, both of which are discussed above.\n\n  \n\n43\n\n* * *\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEmployee Benefit Plans Funded Status and Contributions\n\nEmployer Contributions\n\nWe operate numerous qualified and nonqualified pension plans and other\npostretirement benefit plans.

During 2023,\nwe made a discretionary contribution of $200 million to one of our qualified\npension plans. During 2024 and 2023, we made contributions of $56 million and\n$52 million to our nonqualified pension plans, respectively.", "Our overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of assets that allows us\nto meet projected benefit payments while taking into consideration risk and\nreturn. In an effort to reduce the risk of our portfolio strategy and better\nalign assets with liabilities, we have adopted a liability driven pension\nstrategy that seeks to better match the interest rate sensitivity of the\nliability hedging assets with the interest rate sensitivity of the liability.\nWe expect that the strategy will reduce the likelihood that assets will\ndecline at a time when liabilities increase (referred to as liability\nhedging), with the goal to reduce the risk of underfunding to the plan and its\nparticipants and beneficiaries. Over time, as the asset allocation shifts to\nmore liability hedging assets, this strategy will generally result in lower\nexpected asset returns. For 2025, we expect no required qualified pension plan\ncontributions and insignificant nonqualified pension plan contributions.\n\n  \n\nContributions to our other postretirement benefit plans generally relate to\npayments for benefits on an as-incurred basis since these other postretirement\nbenefit plans do not have funding requirements similar to the pension plans.\nWe contributed $935 million and $936 million to our other postretirement\nbenefit plans in 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Both our wireless licenses and goodwill are treated as indefinite-\nlived intangible assets and, therefore are not amortized, but rather are\ntested for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter, unless there are\nevents requiring an earlier assessment or changes in circumstances during an\ninterim period suggesting impairment indicators are present. We believe our\nestimates and assumptions are reasonable and represent appropriate marketplace\nconsiderations as of the valuation date. Although we use consistent\nmethodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair\nvalue calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates and\nassumptions are uncertain by nature, may change over time and can vary from\nactual results. It is possible that in the future there may be changes in our\nestimates and assumptions, including the timing and amount of future cash\nflows, margins, growth rates, market participant assumptions, comparable\nbenchmark companies and related multiples and discount rates, which could\nresult in different fair value estimates. Significant and adverse changes to\nany one or more of the above-noted estimates and assumptions could result in\nan impairment to our wireless licenses and goodwill impairment for one or more\nof our reporting units.\n\n  \n\n44\n\n* * *\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWireless Licenses\n\nThe carrying value of our wireless licenses was approximately $156.6 billion\nas of December 31, 2024. We aggregate our wireless licenses into one single\nunit of accounting, as we utilize our wireless licenses on an integrated basis\nas part of our nationwide wireless network. Our wireless licenses provide us\nwith the exclusive right to utilize certain radio frequency spectrum to\nprovide wireless communication services. There are currently no legal,\nregulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the\nuseful life of our wireless licenses.\n\n  \n\nWe test our wireless licenses for potential impairment annually or more\nfrequently if impairment indicators are present. We have the option to first\nperform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to\nperform a quantitative impairment test. However, we may elect to bypass the\nqualitative assessment in any period and proceed directly to performing the\nquantitative impairment test. It is our policy to perform quantitative\nimpairment assessment at least every three years.", "Our quantitative impairment assessment consisted of comparing the estimated\nfair value of our aggregate wireless licenses to the aggregated carrying\namount as of the test date. Under our quantitative assessment, we estimated\nthe fair value of our wireless licenses using the Greenfield approach. The\nGreenfield approach is an income based valuation approach that values the\nwireless licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a\nhypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except\nthe wireless licenses to be valued. A discounted cash flow analysis is used to\nestimate what a marketplace participant would be willing to pay to purchase\nthe aggregated wireless licenses as of the valuation date. As a result, we\nwere required to make significant estimates about future cash flows and\nprofitability specifically associated with our wireless licenses, an\nappropriate discount rate based on the risk associated with those estimated\ncash flows and assumed terminal value and growth rates. We considered current\nand expected future economic conditions, current and expected availability of\nwireless network technology and infrastructure and related equipment and the\ncosts thereof as well as other relevant factors in estimating future cash\nflows and profitability. The discount rate represented our estimate of the\nweighted-average cost of capital (WACC), or expected return, that a\nmarketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date and\nincludes a risk premium associated with the current and expected economic\nconditions as of the valuation date. We developed the discount rate based on\nour consideration of the cost of debt and equity of a group of guideline\ncompanies as of the valuation date. The terminal value growth rate represented\nour estimate of the marketplace's long-term growth rate.\n\n  \n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, we performed a qualitative impairment\nassessment as our annual impairment test to determine whether it is more\nlikely than not that the fair value of our wireless licenses was less than the\ncarrying amount. As part of our qualitative assessment we considered several\nfactors including the enterprise value of our combined wireless business,\nmacroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount\nrates), industry and market considerations (including industry revenue and\nEBITDA margin results, projections and recent merger and acquisition\nactivity), the recent and projected financial performance of our combined\nwireless business as a whole, as well as other factors including the result of\nour last quantitative assessment performed in 2021. Our annual impairment test\nin 2023 indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our\nwireless licenses remained above their carrying value and, therefore, did not\nresult in an impairment.\n\n  \n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we performed a quantitative impairment\nassessment in accordance with our policy. The quantitative impairment\nassessment we performed during the fourth quarter of 2024 indicated that the\nfair value of our wireless licenses is substantially in excess of their\ncarrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment. In the event\nof a 10% decline in the fair value of our wireless licenses, the fair value\nwould have still exceeded their carrying value. We do not believe reasonable\nchanges in significant estimates would change the outcome to this quantitative\nassessment. For instance, if either the terminal value growth rate declined by\n50 basis points (bps) or if the WACC increased by 50 bps, the fair value of\nwireless licenses would still exceed their carrying value.\n\n  \n\nGoodwill\n\nAt both December 31, 2024 and 2023, the balance of our goodwill was\napproximately $22.8 billion, of which $21.2 billion was in our Consumer\nreporting unit and $1.7 billion was in our Business reporting unit.", "To determine if goodwill is potentially impaired, we have the option to\nperform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than\nnot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.\nIf we elect not to conduct the qualitative assessment or if indications of a\npotential impairment exist, the determination of whether an impairment has\noccurred requires the fair value of each reporting unit to be assessed. It is\nour policy to perform quantitative impairment assessments at least every three\nyears.\n\n  \n\nUnder the qualitative assessment, we consider several factors, including the\nenterprise value of the reporting unit from the last quantitative test and the\nexcess of fair value over carrying value from this test, macroeconomic\nconditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry\nand market considerations (including industry revenue and EBITDA margin\nresults, projections and recent merger and acquisition activity), the recent\nand projected financial performance of the reporting unit, as well as other\nfactors.\n\n  \n\nUnder the quantitative assessment, the fair value of the reporting unit is\ncalculated using an average of the market approach and a discounted cash flow\nmethod, as a form of the income approach. The market approach includes the use\nof comparative multiples to complement discounted cash flow results. The\ndiscounted cash flow method is based on the present value of two\n\n45\n\n* * *\n\nTable of Contents\n\ncomponents-projected cash flows and a terminal value. The terminal value\nrepresents the expected normalized future cash flows of the reporting unit\nbeyond the cash flows from the discrete projection period. The fair value of\nthe reporting unit using the income approach is calculated based on the sum of\nthe present value of the cash flows from the discrete period and the present\nvalue of the terminal value. The discount rate represents our estimate of the\nWACC, or expected return, that a marketplace participant would have required\nas of the valuation date. The application of our goodwill impairment test\nrequires key assumptions underlying our valuation model. The discounted cash\nflow analysis factors in assumptions on discount rates and terminal growth\nrates to reflect risk profiles of key strategic revenue and cost initiatives,\nas well as revenue and EBITDA growth relative to history and market trends and\nexpectations. The market multiples approach reflects significant judgment\ninvolved in the selection of comparable public company multiples and\nbenchmarks. The selection of companies and multiples is influenced by\ndifferences in growth and profitability, and volatility in market prices of\npeer companies. These valuation inputs are inherently judgmental, and an\nadverse change in one or a combination of these inputs could result in a\ngoodwill impairment.\n\n  \n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, we performed a qualitative impairment\nassessment for our Consumer reporting unit. Our qualitative assessment\nindicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our Consumer\nreporting unit exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, did not result in\nan impairment.", "During the fourth quarter of 2024, we performed a quantitative impairment\nassessment for our Consumer reporting unit in accordance with our policy. We\napplied a combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method\nreflecting current assumptions and inputs, including our revised projections,\ndiscount rate and expected growth rates. Our assessment indicated that the\nfair value of our Consumer reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying\nvalue and, therefore, did not result in an impairment. In the event of a 10%\ndecline in the fair value of our Consumer reporting unit, the fair value of\nthe Consumer reporting unit would have still exceeded its book value. We do\nnot believe reasonable changes in significant assumptions would change the\noutcome to this quantitative assessment. For instance, if either the terminal\nvalue growth rate declined by 50 bps or if the discount rate increased by 50\nbps, the fair value of our Consumer reporting unit would still exceed its\ncarrying value.\n\n  \n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, we performed a quantitative impairment\nassessment for our Business reporting unit given the low excess of fair value\nover carrying value identified in our 2022 annual impairment assessment and\nincreased competitive and market pressures experienced throughout 2023. These\npressures resulted in lower projected cash flows primarily driven by secular\ndeclines in wireline services and products across our Business customer\ngroups. In connection with Verizon's annual budget process in the fourth\nquarter of 2023, leadership completed a comprehensive five-year strategic\nplanning review of our Business reporting unit resulting in declines in\nfinancial projections driven by market dynamics as compared to the prior year\nfive-year strategic planning cycle. The revised projections were used as a key\ninput into the Business reporting unit's annual goodwill impairment test\nperformed in the fourth quarter of 2023. In addition, changes in the\nmacroeconomic environment, including interest rate and inflationary pressures\nalso impacted the fair value of the reporting unit. We applied a combination\nof a market approach and a discounted cash flow method reflecting current\nassumptions and inputs, including our revised projections, discount rate and\nexpected growth rates, which resulted in the determination that the fair value\nof our Business reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. As a result,\nin the fourth quarter of 2023, we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment\ncharge of approximately $5.8 billion ($5.8 billion after-tax) in our\nconsolidated statement of income. The goodwill balance of the Business\nreporting unit was approximately $7.5 billion prior to the occurrence of this\nimpairment charge.", "During the fourth quarter of 2024, we performed a quantitative impairment\nassessment for our Business reporting unit given the impairment of the\nBusiness reporting unit's goodwill in the prior year. In addition, the\nBusiness reporting unit has continued to experience competitive and market\npressures throughout 2024, that may persist over the near term. We applied a\ncombination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method reflecting\ncurrent assumptions and inputs, including our revised projections, discount\nrate and expected growth rates, which indicated that the fair value of our\nBusiness reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, did not\nresult in an impairment. At the goodwill impairment measurement date of\nOctober 31, 2024, our Business reporting unit had a fair value that exceeded\nits carrying amount by approximately 8% and remains susceptible to future\nimpairment risk. We do not anticipate reasonable changes in significant\nassumptions to change the outcome of the quantitative impairment assessment.\nFor instance, if either the terminal value growth rate declined by 50 bps, or\nif the discount rate increased by 50 bps, or if the EBITDA margin decreased by\n100 basis points, the fair value of our Business reporting unit would still\nexceed its carrying value. However, management believes there is a continued\nrisk that our Business reporting unit may be required to recognize an\nimpairment charge in the future. As of December 31, 2024, $1.7 billion of\ngoodwill was allocated to our Business reporting unit. See Note 4 to the\nconsolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\n  \n\nA projected sustained decline in the reporting unit's revenues and earnings\ncould have a significant negative impact on its fair value and could result in\nfuture impairment charges. Such a decline could be driven by, among other\nthings: (1) decreases in sales volumes or long-term growth rate as a result of\ncompetitive pressures or other factors; or (2) the reporting unit's inability\nto achieve or delays in achieving its goals or strategic initiatives. Adverse\nchanges to macroeconomic factors, such as increases in long-term interest\nrates, would also negatively impact the fair value of the reporting unit.\n\n  \n\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans\n\nWe maintain benefit plans for most of our employees, including, for certain\nemployees, pension and other postretirement benefit plans.

The\nexpected long-term rates of return on plan assets used in determining\nVerizon's pension and other postretirement obligations are based on\nexpectations for future investment returns for the plans' asset allocation.\nThe rates are subject to uncertainty for a number of reasons including\ncorporate performance, credit ratings, monetary policy, inflation, exchange\nrates, investor behavior and general market volatility.\n\n  \n\nA sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in the discount rate and the\nlong-term rate of return on plan assets on the benefit obligations and expense\n(income) recorded, as well as an increase or a decrease in the actual versus\nexpected return on plan assets as of December 31, 2024 and for the year then\nended pertaining to Verizon's pension and postretirement benefit plans, is\nprovided in the table below. The amounts in the table below related to\ndiscount rate changes are gross impacts on benefit obligations and expense,\nand do not reflect changes in asset values as a result of interest rate\nchanges, for which our pension plan is highly hedged.\n\n| | | | | | | |   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n(dollars in millions)| Percentage point  \nchange| Increase/(Decrease) at December 31, 2024  \nPension plans discount rate| +0.50| $| (410)|  \n| -0.50| 451 |   \nRate of return on pension plan assets| +1.00| (78)|  \n| -1.00| 78 |   \nPostretirement plans discount rate| +0.50| (450)|  \n| -0.50| 486 |   \nRate of return on postretirement plan assets| +1.00| (4)|  \n| -1.00| 4 |   \n| |   \n| |   \n  \n  \n\nIn addition to our liability hedging assets, we also employ an interest rate\nhedging strategy to further minimize the impact of discount rate changes on\nthe funded ratio of the pension plan. While the target hedge ratio varies\ndepending on the funded status of the plan and the level of interest rates,\nthe target hedge ratio was 60% at December 31, 2024, limiting volatility.\n\n  \n\nThe annual measurement date for both our pension and other postretirement\nbenefits is December 31. We use the full yield curve approach to estimate the\ninterest cost component of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other\npostretirement benefits. The full yield curve approach refines our estimate of\ninterest cost by applying the individual spot rates from a yield curve\ncomposed of the rates of return on several hundred high-quality fixed income\ncorporate bonds available at the measurement date. These individual spot rates\nalign with the timing of each future cash outflow for benefit payments and\ntherefore provide a more precise estimate of interest cost.\n\n  \nSee Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional\ninformation.\n\n  \n\nIncome Taxes", "See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional\ninformation.\n\n  \n\nIncome Taxes\n\nOur current and deferred income taxes and associated valuation allowances are\nimpacted by events and transactions arising in the normal course of business\nas well as in connection with the adoption of new accounting standards,\nchanges in tax laws and rates, acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and\nnon-recurring items. As a global commercial enterprise, our income tax rate\nand the classification of income taxes can be affected by many factors,\nincluding estimates of the timing and realization of deferred income tax\nassets and the timing and amount of income tax payments. We account for tax\nbenefits taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in accordance with\nthe accounting standard relating to the uncertainty in income taxes, which\nrequires the use of a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax\nbenefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We review and adjust\nour liability for unrecognized tax benefits based on our best judgment given\nthe facts, circumstances and information available at each reporting date. To\nthe extent that the final outcome of these tax positions is different than the\namounts recorded, such differences may impact income tax expense and actual\ntax payments. We recognize any interest and penalties accrued related to\nunrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Actual tax payments may\nmaterially differ from estimated liabilities as a result of changes in tax\nlaws as well as unanticipated transactions impacting related income tax\nbalances. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional\ninformation.\n\n  \n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\n\nOur Property, plant and equipment balance represents a significant component\nof our consolidated assets. We record property, plant and equipment at cost.\nWe depreciate property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over the\nestimated useful life of the assets. The estimated useful life is subject to\nchange due to a variety of factors such as change in asset capacity or\n\n47\n\n* * *\n\nTable of Contents\n\nperformance, technical obsolescence, market expectations and competitive\nimpacts. In connection with our ongoing review of the estimated useful lives\nof property, plant and equipment during 2024, we determined that the estimated\nuseful life of our property, plant and equipment would remain unchanged. We\nexpect that a one year increase in estimated useful lives of our property,\nplant and equipment would result in a decrease to our 2024 depreciation\nexpense of $2.4 billion and that a one year decrease would result in an\nincrease of approximately $3.6 billion in our 2024 depreciation expense.\n\n  \n\nAccounts Receivable\n\nAccounts receivable are recorded at amortized cost less an allowance for\ncredit losses that are not expected to be recovered. The gross amount of\naccounts receivable and corresponding allowance for credit losses are\npresented separately in the consolidated balance sheets. We maintain\nallowances for credit losses resulting from the expected failure or inability\nof our customers to make required payments. We recognize the allowance for\ncredit losses at inception and reassess quarterly based on management's\nexpectation of the asset's collectability. The allowance is based on multiple\nfactors including historical experience with bad debts, the credit quality of\nthe customer base, the aging of such receivables and current macroeconomic\nconditions, as well as management's expectations of conditions in the future,\nas applicable. The impact of these factors on the allowance involves\nsignificant level of estimation and is subject to uncertainty. Our allowance\nfor credit losses is based on management's assessment of the collectability of\nassets pooled together with similar risk characteristics.", "We record an allowance to reduce the receivables to the amount that is\nexpected to be collectible. For device payment plan agreement receivables, we\nrecord bad debt expense based on a default and loss calculation using our\nproprietary loss model. The expected loss rate is determined based on customer\ncredit scores and other qualitative factors as noted above. The loss rate is\nassigned individually on a customer by customer basis and the custom credit\nscores are then aggregated by vintage and used in our proprietary loss model\nto calculate the weighted-average loss rate used for determining the allowance\nbalance. The weighted-average expected loss rate increased 0.75% at December\n31, 2024 as compared to the rate at December 31, 2023. We expect that an\nincrease or decrease of 0.25% in the weighted-average loss rate would result\nin a change of $160 million in bad debt expense.\n\n  \n\nWe monitor the collectability of our wireless service receivables as one\noverall pool. Wireline service receivables are disaggregated and pooled by the\nfollowing types of customers and related contracts: consumer, small and medium\nbusiness, enterprise, public sector and wholesale. For wireless service\nreceivables and wireline consumer and small and medium business receivables,\nthe allowance is calculated based on a 12 month rolling average write-off\nbalance multiplied by the average life-cycle of an account from billing to\nwrite-off. The risk of loss is assessed over the contractual life of the\nreceivables and is adjusted based on the historical loss amounts for current\nand future conditions based on management's qualitative considerations. For\nenterprise, public sector and wholesale wireline receivables, the allowance\nfor credit losses is based on historical write-off experience and individual\ncustomer credit risk, if applicable. We consider multiple factors in\ndetermining the allowance as discussed above.\n\n  \n\nIf there is a deterioration of our customers' financial condition or if future\nactual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently\nanticipated, we may have to adjust our allowance for credit losses, which\nwould affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made.

We believe these spectrum license transactions have allowed us to\ncontinue to enhance the reliability of our wireless network while also\nresulting in a more efficient use of spectrum.\n\n  \n\nIn February 2021, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) concluded\nAuction 107 for C-Band wireless spectrum. In accordance with the rules\napplicable to the auction, Verizon is required to make payments for our\nallocable share of clearing costs incurred by, and incentive payments due to,\nthe incumbent license holders associated with the auction, which are estimated\nto be $7.5 billion. During 2024, 2023 and 2022, we made payments of $269\nmillion, $4.3 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, for obligations related\nto clearing costs and accelerated clearing incentives. The carrying value of\nthe wireless spectrum won in Auction 107 consists of all payments required to\nparticipate and purchase licenses in the auction, including Verizon's\nallocable share of clearing costs incurred by, and incentive payments due to,\nthe incumbent license holders associated with the auction that we are\nobligated to pay in order to acquire the licenses, as well as capitalized\ninterest to the extent qualifying activities have occurred.", "In March 2022, Verizon signed agreements with satellite operators in which\noperators agreed to clear C-Band spectrum in certain markets and frequencies\nahead of the previously expected timeframe. During 2022, Verizon incurred\ncosts associated with these agreements of approximately $340 million, of which\n$310 million was paid as of December 31, 2022 and the remainder was paid in\n2023.

The fair value of the\ncommon stock was determined on the basis of its closing market price on the\nAcquisition Date. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration as\nof the Acquisition Date was approximately $560 million and represented a Level\n3 measurement. The contingent consideration payable was based on the\nachievement of certain revenue and operational targets, measured over a two\nyear earn out period. Contingent consideration payments were completed in\nJanuary of 2024.\n\n  \n\nDuring 2024 and 2023, Verizon made payments of $52 million and $257 million,\nrespectively, related to the contingent consideration, which are reflected in\nCash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash\nflows. See Note 3 and Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for\nadditional information.\n\n  \n\nFrontier Communications Parent, Inc.\n\nOn September 4, 2024, Verizon entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger\n(the Merger Agreement) to acquire Frontier, a U.S. provider of broadband\ninternet and other communication services. The transaction is structured as a\nmerger of the Company's subsidiary with and into Frontier, as a result of\nwhich Frontier will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and shares\nof Frontier common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time\nof merger (subject to certain limited exceptions) will be cancelled and\nconverted into the right to receive a per share merger consideration of\n$38.50, in cash.

For example, we tested\ncontrols over management's review of the employee benefit obligation\ncalculations, the actuarial assumption relating to the discount rates and the\ndata inputs provided to the actuary.  \n  \nTo test the employee benefit obligations, our audit procedures included, among\nothers, evaluating the methodologies used, the actuarial assumption relating\nto the discount rates and the underlying data used by the Company. We compared\nthe actuarial assumption used by management to historical trends, current\neconomic factors and evaluated the change in the employee benefit obligations\nfrom prior year due to the change in service cost, interest cost, actuarial\ngains and losses, benefit payments, contributions and other activities.

Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries  \n  \n| |   \n---|---|---  \nNote 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  \n  \nDescription of Business\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (the Company) is a holding company that, acting\nthrough its subsidiaries (together with the Company, collectively, Verizon),\nis one of the world's leading providers of communications, technology,\ninformation and streaming products and services to consumers, businesses and\ngovernment entities. With a presence around the world, we offer data, video\nand voice services and solutions on our networks and platforms that are\ndesigned to meet customers' demand for mobility, reliable network connectivity\nand security.\n\n  \n\nWe have two reportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic\nbusiness units - Verizon Consumer Group (Consumer) and Verizon Business Group\n(Business).\n\n  \n\nOur Consumer segment provides consumer-focused wireless and wireline\ncommunications services and products. Our wireless services are provided\nacross one of the most extensive wireless networks in the United States (U.S.)\nunder the Verizon family of brands and through wholesale and other\narrangements. We also provide fixed wireless access (FWA) broadband through\nour fifth-generation (5G) or fourth-generation (4G) Long-Term Evolution (LTE)\nnetworks as an alternative to traditional landline internet access. Our\nwireline services are provided in nine states in the Mid-Atlantic and\nNortheastern U.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our 100% fiber-optic\nnetwork through our Verizon Fios product portfolio and over a traditional\ncopper-based network to customers who are not served by Fios.\n\n  \n\nOur Business segment provides wireless and wireline communications services\nand products, including FWA broadband, data, video and advanced communication\nservices, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network\nservices, local and long distance voice services and network access to deliver\nvarious Internet of Things (IoT) services and products. We provide these\nproducts and services to businesses, public sector customers and wireless and\nwireline carriers across the U.S. and a subset of these products and services\nto customers around the world.\n\n  \n\nConsolidation\n\nThe method of accounting applied to investments, whether consolidated or\nequity, involves an evaluation of all significant terms of the investments\nthat explicitly grant or suggest evidence of control or influence over the\noperations of the investee. The consolidated financial statements include our\ncontrolled subsidiaries, as well as variable interest entities (VIE) where we\nare deemed to be the primary beneficiary. For controlled subsidiaries that are\nnot wholly-owned, the noncontrolling interests are included in Net income and\nTotal equity. Investments in businesses that we do not control, but have the\nability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial\npolicies, are accounted for using the equity method. Equity method investments\nare included in Investments in unconsolidated businesses in our consolidated\nbalance sheets. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have\nbeen eliminated.\n\n  \n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nWe have reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the current year\npresentation.\n\n  \n\nUse of Estimates\n\nWe prepare our financial statements using U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (GAAP), which requires management to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect reported amounts and disclosures. These estimates and assumptions\ntake into account historical and forward-looking factors that the Company\nbelieves are reasonable. Actual results could differ significantly from those\nestimates.", "Examples of significant estimates include the allowance for credit losses, the\nrecoverability of property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets,\nthe incremental borrowing rate for the lease liability, fair value\nmeasurements, including those related to financial instruments, goodwill,\nspectrum licenses and intangible assets, unrecognized tax benefits, valuation\nallowances on tax assets, pension and postretirement benefit obligations,\ncontingencies and the identification and valuation of assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed in connection with business combinations.\n\n  \n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nWe earn revenue from contracts with customers, primarily through the provision\nof telecommunications and other services and through the sale of wireless\nequipment. These services include a variety of communication and connectivity\nservices for our Consumer and Business customers including other carriers that\nuse our facilities to provide services to their customers, as well as\nprofessional and integrated managed services for our large enterprise and\ngovernment customers. We account for these revenues under Topic 606.\n\n  \n\n59\n\n* * *\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe also earn revenues that are not accounted for under Topic 606 from leasing\narrangements (such as those for towers and equipment), captive reinsurance\narrangements primarily related to wireless device insurance and the interest\nrecognized when equipment is sold to the customer by an authorized agent under\na device payment plan agreement.\n\n  \n\nNature of Products and Services\n\nTelecommunications\n\nService\n\nWe offer wireless services through a variety of plans on a postpaid or prepaid\nbasis. For wireless service, we recognize revenue using an output method,\neither as the service allowance units are used or as time elapses, because it\nreflects the pattern by which we satisfy our performance obligation through\nthe transfer of service to the customer. Monthly service is generally billed\nin advance, which results in a contract liability. See Note 2 for additional\ninformation. For postpaid plans, where monthly usage exceeds the allowance,\nthe overage usage represents options held by the customer for incremental\nservices and the usage-based fee is recognized when the customer exercises the\noption (typically on a month-to-month basis).\n\n  \n\nFor our contracts related to wireline communication and connectivity services,\nin general, fixed monthly fees for service are billed one month in advance,\nwhich results in a contract liability, and service revenue is recognized over\nthe enforceable contract term as the service is rendered, as the customer\nsimultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services through\nnetwork access and usage. While substantially all of our wireline service\nrevenue contracts are the result of providing access to our networks, revenue\nfrom services that are not fixed in amount and, instead, are based on usage\nare generally billed in arrears and recognized as the usage occurs.\n\n  \n\nEquipment\n\nWe sell wireless devices and accessories under the Verizon brand and other\nbrands. Equipment revenue is generally recognized when the products are\ndelivered to and accepted by the customer, as this is when control passes to\nthe customer. In addition to offering the sale of equipment on a standalone\nbasis, we have two primary offerings through which customers pay for a\nwireless device, in connection with a service contract: fixed-term plans (for\nour Business customers) and device payment plans.\n\n  \n\nUnder a fixed-term plan, the customer is sold the wireless device without any\nupfront charge or at a discounted price in exchange for entering into a fixed-\nterm service contract (typically for a term of 36 months or less).", "Under a device payment plan, the customer is sold the wireless device in\nexchange for a non-interest-bearing installment note, which is repaid by the\ncustomer, typically over a 36-month term, and concurrently enters into a\nmonth-to-month contract for wireless service. We may offer certain promotions\nthat provide billing credits applied over a specified term, contingent upon\nthe customer maintaining service. The credits are included in the transaction\nprice, which are allocated to the performance obligations based on their\nrelative selling price and are recognized when earned.\n\n  \n\nA financing component exists in both our fixed-term plans and device payment\nplans because the timing of the payment for the device, which occurs over the\ncontract term, differs from the satisfaction of the performance obligation,\nwhich occurs at contract inception upon transfer of the device to the\ncustomer. We periodically assess, at the contract level, the significance of\nthe financing component inherent in our fixed-term and device payment plan\nreceivable based on qualitative and quantitative considerations related to our\ncustomer classes. These considerations include assessing the commercial\nobjective of our plans, the term and duration of financing provided, interest\nrates prevailing in the marketplace, and credit risks of our customer classes,\nall of which impact our selection of appropriate discount rates. Based on\ncurrent facts and circumstances, we determined that the financing component in\nour existing wireless device payments and fixed-term contracts sold through\nthe direct channel is not significant and therefore is not accounted for\nseparately. See Note 8 for additional information on the interest on equipment\nfinanced on a device payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an\nauthorized agent in our indirect channel.\n\n  \n\nWireless Contracts\n\nFor our wireless contracts, total contract revenue, which represents the\ntransaction price for wireless service and wireless equipment, is allocated\nbetween service and equipment revenue based on their estimated standalone\nselling prices. We estimate the standalone selling price of the device or\naccessory to be its retail price excluding subsidies or conditional purchase\ndiscounts. We estimate the standalone selling price of wireless service to be\nthe price that we offer to customers on month-to-month contracts that can be\ncancelled at any time without penalty (i.e., when there is no fixed-term for\nservice) or when service is procured without the concurrent purchase of a\nwireless device. In addition, we also assess whether the service term is\nimpacted by certain legally enforceable rights and obligations in our contract\nwith customers, such as penalties that a customer would have to pay to early\nterminate a fixed-term contract or billing credits that would cease if the\nmonth-to-month wireless service is canceled. The assessment of these legally\nenforceable rights and obligations involves judgment and impacts our\ndetermination of the transaction price and related disclosures.\n\n  \n\nFrom time to time, we may offer certain promotions that provide our customers\non device payment plans with the right to upgrade to a new device after paying\na specified portion of their device payment plan agreement amount and trading\nin their device in good working order. We account for this trade-in right as a\nguarantee obligation. The full amount of the trade-in right's fair value is\nrecognized as a guarantee liability and results in a reduction to the revenue\nrecognized upon the sale of the device. The total\n\n60\n\n* * *\n\nTable of Contents\n\ntransaction price is reduced by the guarantee, which is accounted for outside\nthe scope of Topic 606, and the remaining transaction price is allocated\nbetween the performance obligations within the contract.", "Our fixed-term plans generally include the sale of a wireless device at\nsubsidized prices. This results in the creation of a contract asset at the\ntime of sale, which represents the recognition of equipment revenue in excess\nof amounts billed.\n\n  \n\nFor our device payment plans, billing credits are accounted for as\nconsideration payable to a customer and are included in the determination of\ntotal transaction price, resulting in a contract liability.\n\n  \n\nWe may provide a right of return on our products and services for a short time\nperiod after a sale. These rights are accounted for as variable consideration\nwhen determining the transaction price, and accordingly we recognize revenue\nbased on the estimated amount to which we expect to be entitled after\nconsidering expected returns. Returns and credits are estimated at contract\ninception and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional\ninformation becomes available. We also may provide credits or incentives on\nour products and services for contracts with resellers, which are accounted\nfor as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to\nrecognize.\n\n  \n\nWireline Contracts\n\nTotal consideration for wireline services that are bundled in a single\ncontract is allocated to each performance obligation based on our standalone\nselling price for each service. While many contracts include one or more\nservice performance obligations, the revenue recognition pattern is generally\nnot impacted by the allocation since the services are generally satisfied over\nthe same period of time. We estimate the standalone selling price to be the\nprice of the services when sold on a standalone basis without any promotional\ndiscount. In addition, we also assess whether the service term is impacted by\ncertain legally enforceable rights and obligations in our contract with\ncustomers such as penalties that a customer would have to pay to early\nterminate a fixed-term contract. The assessment of these legally enforceable\nrights and obligations involves judgment and impacts our determination of\ntransaction price and related disclosures.\n\n  \n\nWe may provide performance-based credits or incentives on our products and\nservices for contracts with our Business customers, which are accounted for as\nvariable consideration when estimating the transaction price. Credits are\nestimated at contract inception and are updated at the end of each reporting\nperiod as additional information becomes available.\n\n  \n\nWireless and Wireline Contracts\n\nFor offers that include third-party providers, we evaluate whether we are\nacting as the principal or as the agent with respect to the goods or services\nprovided to the customer. This principal-versus-agent assessment involves\njudgment and focuses on whether the facts and circumstances of the arrangement\nindicate that the goods or services were controlled by us prior to\ntransferring them to the customer. To evaluate if we have control, we consider\nvarious factors including whether we are primarily responsible for\nfulfillment, bear risk of loss and have discretion over pricing.\n\n  \n\nOther\n\nWe offer telematics services including smart fleet management and optimization\nsoftware. Telematics service revenue is generated primarily through\nsubscription contracts. We recognize revenue over time for our subscription\ncontracts.\n\n  \n\nWe report taxes collected from customers on behalf of governmental authorities\non revenue-producing transactions on a net basis.\n\n  \n\nMaintenance and Repairs\n\nWe charge the cost of maintenance and repairs, including the cost of replacing\nminor items not constituting substantial betterments, principally to Cost of\nservices as these costs are incurred.\n\n  \n\nAdvertising Costs\n\nCosts for advertising products and services, as well as other promotional and\nsponsorship costs, are charged to Selling, general and administrative expense\nin the periods in which they are incurred.

For investments in debt\nsecurities without quoted prices, Verizon uses an alternative matrix pricing\nmethod. Investments in equity securities that do not result in consolidation\nof the investee are included in Investments in unconsolidated businesses and\ndebt securities are included in Other assets in our consolidated balance\nsheets.\n\n  \n\nAllowance for Credit Losses\n\nAccounts receivable are recorded at amortized cost less an allowance for\ncredit losses that are not expected to be recovered. The gross amount of\naccounts receivable and corresponding allowance for credit losses are\npresented separately in the consolidated balance sheets. We maintain\nallowances for credit losses resulting from the expected failure or inability\nof our customers to make required payments. We recognize the allowance for\ncredit losses at inception and reassess quarterly based on management's\nexpectation of the asset's collectability. The allowance is based on multiple\nfactors including historical experience with bad debts, the credit quality of\nthe customer base, the aging of such receivables and current macroeconomic\nconditions, as well as management's expectations of conditions in the future,\nas applicable. Our allowance for credit losses is based on management's\nassessment of the collectability of assets pooled together with similar risk\ncharacteristics.", "We pool our device payment plan agreement receivables based on the credit\nquality indicators and shared risk characteristics of \"new customers\" and\n\"existing customers.\" New customers are defined as customers who have been\nwith Verizon for less than 210 days. Existing customers are defined as\ncustomers who have been with Verizon for 210 days or more. We record an\nallowance to reduce the receivables to the amount that is expected to be\ncollectible. For device payment plan agreement receivables, we record bad debt\nexpense based on a default and loss calculation using our proprietary loss\nmodel. The expected loss rate is determined based on customer credit scores\nand other qualitative factors as noted above. The loss rate is assigned\nindividually on a customer by customer basis and the custom credit scores are\nthen aggregated by vintage and used in our proprietary loss model to calculate\nthe weighted-average loss rate used for determining the allowance balance.\n\n  \n\nWe monitor the collectability of our wireless service receivables as one\noverall pool. Wireline service receivables are disaggregated and pooled by the\nfollowing types of customers and related contracts: consumer, small and medium\nbusiness, enterprise, public sector and wholesale. For wireless service\nreceivables and wireline consumer and small and medium business receivables,\nthe allowance is calculated based on a 12 month rolling average write-off\nbalance multiplied by the average life-cycle of an account from billing to\nwrite-off. The risk of loss is assessed over the contractual life of the\nreceivables and is adjusted based on the historical loss amounts for current\nand future conditions based on management's qualitative considerations. For\nenterprise, public sector and wholesale wireline receivables, the allowance\nfor credit losses is based on historical write-off experience and individual\ncustomer credit risk, if applicable. We consider multiple factors in\ndetermining the allowance as discussed above.\n\n  \n\nInventories\n\nInventory consists of wireless and wireline equipment held for sale, which is\ncarried at the lower of cost (determined principally on either an average cost\nor first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value.\n\n  \n\n62\n\n* * *\n\nTable of Contents\n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation\n\nWe record property, plant and equipment at cost.

We also capitalize interest associated\nwith the acquisition or construction of network-related assets. Capitalized\ninterest is reported as a reduction in interest expense and depreciated as\npart of the cost of the network-related assets.\n\n  \n\nComputer Software and Cloud Computing Costs", "Computer Software and Cloud Computing Costs\n\nWe capitalize the cost of internal-use network and non-network software and\ndefer the costs associated with cloud computing service arrangements that have\na useful life and term in excess of one year.

Similar to capitalized software costs, deferred\ncosts associated with cloud computing arrangements are subject to impairment\ntesting.\n\n  \n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill\n\nGoodwill is the excess of the acquisition cost of businesses over the fair\nvalue of the identifiable net assets acquired. Impairment testing for goodwill\nis performed annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if impairment\nindicators are present.\n\n  \n\nTo determine if goodwill is potentially impaired, we have the option to\nperform a qualitative assessment. However, we may elect to bypass the\nqualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test even if no\nindications of a potential impairment exist. It is our policy to perform\nquantitative impairment assessment at least every three years.\n\n  \n\nUnder the qualitative assessment, we consider several factors, including the\nenterprise value of the reporting unit from the last quantitative test and the\nexcess of fair value over carrying value from this test, macroeconomic\nconditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry\nand market considerations (including industry revenue and earnings before\ninterest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin results,\nprojections and recent merger and acquisition activity), the recent and\nprojected financial performance of the reporting unit, as well as other\nfactors.", "The quantitative impairment test for goodwill is performed at the reporting\nunit level and compares the fair value of the reporting unit (calculated using\na combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method, as a\nform of the income approach) to its carrying value. Estimated fair values of\nreporting units are Level 3 measures in the fair value hierarchy, see \"Fair\nValue Measurements\" discussion below for additional information. The market\napproach includes the use of comparative multiples of guideline companies to\ncomplement discounted cash flow results. The discounted cash flow method is\nbased on the present value of two components, projected cash flows and a\nterminal value. The terminal value represents the expected normalized future\ncash flows of the reporting unit beyond the cash flows from the discrete\nprojection period. The fair value of the reporting unit is calculated based on\nthe sum of the present value of the cash flows from the discrete period and\nthe present value of the terminal value. The discount rate represents our\nestimate of the weighted-average cost of capital, or expected return, that a\nmarketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date. If the\ncarrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is booked for the\nexcess carrying value over fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill\nof that reporting unit. During the fourth quarter each year, we update our\nthree-year strategic planning review for each of our reporting units. Those\nplans consider current economic conditions and trends, estimated future\noperating results, our view of growth-rates and anticipated future economic\nand regulatory conditions.\n\n  \n\nSee Note 4 for additional information regarding our goodwill impairment\ntesting.\n\n63\n\n* * *\n\nTable of Contents\n\n  \n\nIntangible Assets Not Subject to Amortization\n\nA significant portion of our intangible assets are wireless licenses that\nprovide our wireless operations with the exclusive right to utilize designated\nradio frequency spectrum to provide wireless communication services. While\nlicenses are issued for only a fixed time, generally ten to fifteen years,\nsuch licenses are subject to renewal by the Federal Communications Commission\n(FCC). License renewals have occurred routinely and at nominal cost. Moreover,\nwe have determined that there are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual,\ncompetitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful life of our\nwireless licenses. As a result, we treat the wireless licenses as an\nindefinite-lived intangible asset. We re-evaluate the useful life\ndetermination for wireless licenses each year to determine whether events and\ncircumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. We aggregate our\nwireless licenses into one single unit of accounting, as we utilize our\nwireless licenses on an integrated basis as part of our nationwide wireless\nnetwork.\n\n  \n\nWe test our wireless licenses for potential impairment annually or more\nfrequently if impairment indicators are present. We have the option to first\nperform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to\nperform a quantitative impairment test. However, we may elect to bypass the\nqualitative assessment in any period and proceed directly to performing the\nquantitative impairment test. It is our policy to perform quantitative\nimpairment assessment at least every three years.", "As part of our qualitative assessment we consider several factors including\nthe enterprise value of our combined wireless business, macroeconomic\nconditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry\nand market considerations (including industry revenue and EBITDA margin\nresults, projections and recent merger and acquisition activity), the recent\nand projected financial performance of our combined wireless business as a\nwhole, as well as other factors including the result of our last quantitative\nassessment. See Note 4 for additional information regarding our impairment\ntests.\n\n  \n\nOur quantitative impairment assessment consists of comparing the estimated\nfair value of our aggregate wireless licenses to the aggregated carrying\namount as of the test date. Under our quantitative assessment, we estimate the\nfair value of our wireless licenses using the Greenfield approach. The\nGreenfield approach is an income based valuation approach that values the\nwireless licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a\nhypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except\nthe wireless licenses to be valued. A discounted cash flow analysis is used to\nestimate what a marketplace participant would be willing to pay to purchase\nthe aggregated wireless licenses as of the valuation date. If the estimated\nfair value of the aggregated wireless licenses is less than the aggregated\ncarrying amount of the wireless licenses, then an impairment charge is\nrecognized.\n\n  \n\nInterest expense incurred while qualifying activities are performed to ready\nwireless licenses for their intended use is capitalized as part of wireless\nlicenses. The capitalization period ends when the development is discontinued\nor substantially completed and the license is ready for its intended use.\n\n  \n\nWireless licenses can be purchased through public auctions conducted by the\nFCC. Deposits required to participate in these auctions and purchase licenses\nare recorded within Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets until the\ncorresponding licenses are received and within Net cash used in investing\nactivities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n  \n\nIntangible Assets Subject to Amortization and Long-Lived Assets\n\nOur intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives (primarily customer\nlists and non-network internal-use software) are amortized over their\nestimated useful lives. All of our intangible assets subject to amortization\nand other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or\nchanges in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may\nnot be recoverable. If any indications of impairment are present, we would\ntest for recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to\nthe net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the asset group.\nIf those net undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying amount, we\nwould perform the next step, which is to determine the fair value of the asset\ngroup and record an impairment, if any. We re-evaluate the useful life\ndeterminations for these intangible assets each year to determine whether\nevents and circumstances warrant a revision to their remaining useful lives.\n\n  \n\nSee Note 4 for information related to the carrying amount of goodwill,\nwireless licenses and other intangible assets, as well as the major components\nand average useful lives of our other acquired intangible assets.\n\n  \n\nLeases", "Leases\n\nWe lease network equipment including towers, distributed antenna systems,\nsmall cells, real estate, connectivity mediums which include dark fiber,\nequipment, and other various types of assets for use in our operations under\nboth operating and finance leases. We assess whether an arrangement is a lease\nor contains a lease at inception. For arrangements considered leases or that\ncontain a lease that is accounted for separately, we determine the\nclassification and initial measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease\nliability at the lease commencement date, which is the date that the\nunderlying asset becomes available for use.\n\n  \n\nFor both operating and finance leases, we recognize a right-of-use asset,\nwhich represents our right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and\na lease liability, which represents the present value of our obligation to\nmake payments arising over the lease term. The present value of the lease\npayments is calculated using the incremental borrowing rate for operating and\nfinance leases. The incremental borrowing rate is determined using a portfolio\napproach based on the rate of interest that the Company\n\n64\n\n* * *\n\nTable of Contents\n\nwould have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a\ncollateralized basis over a similar term. Management uses the unsecured\nborrowing rate and risk-adjusts that rate to approximate a collateralized\nrate, which is updated on a quarterly basis.\n\n  \n\nIn those circumstances where Verizon is the lessee, we account for non-lease\ncomponents associated with our leases (e.g., common area maintenance costs)\nand lease components as a single lease component for substantially all of our\nasset classes. Additionally, in arrangements where we are the lessor, we have\ncustomer premise equipment for which we account for non-lease components\n(e.g., service revenue) and lease components as combined components under the\nrevenue recognition guidance in Topic 606 as the service revenues are the\npredominant components in the arrangements.\n\n  \n\nRent expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over\nthe term of the lease and is included in either Cost of services or Selling,\ngeneral and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income,\nbased on the use of the facility or equipment on which rent is being paid.\nVariable rent payments related to both operating and finance leases are\nexpensed in the period incurred. Our variable lease payments consist of\npayments dependent on various external indicators, including real estate\ntaxes, common area maintenance charges and utility usage.\n\n  \n\nOperating leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded in our\nconsolidated balance sheets; we recognize rent expense for these leases on a\nstraight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n  \n\nWe recognize the amortization of the right-of-use asset for our finance leases\non a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life\nof the right-of-use asset in Depreciation and amortization expense in our\nconsolidated statements of income. The interest expense related to finance\nleases is recognized using the effective interest method based on the discount\nrate determined at lease commencement and is included within Interest expense\nin our consolidated statements of income.\n\n  \n\nSee Note 6 for additional information related to leases, including disclosure\nrequired under Topic 842.\n\n  \n\nFair Value Measurements\n\nFair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities is defined as\nan exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset\nor paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants. The three-tier hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair\nvalue, which prioritizes the inputs used in the methodologies of measuring\nfair value for assets and liabilities, is as follows:\n\n  \n\nLevel 1 -- Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities", "Level 1 -- Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n\nLevel 2 -- Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for\nidentical assets and liabilities\n\nLevel 3 -- Unobservable pricing inputs in the market\n\n  \n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are classified in their entirety\nbased on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurements. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the\nfair value measurements requires judgment and may affect the valuation of the\nassets and liabilities being measured and their categorization within the fair\nvalue hierarchy.\n\n  \n\nIncome Taxes\n\nOur effective tax rate is based on pre-tax income, statutory tax rates, tax\nlaws and regulations and tax planning strategies available to us in the\nvarious jurisdictions in which we operate.\n\n  \n\nDeferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences in the basis\nbetween financial statement and income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred\nincome taxes are recalculated annually at tax rates in effect for the years in\nwhich those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled.\nWe record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount\nthat is more likely than not to be realized.\n\n  \n\nWe use a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or\nexpected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is recognition: we\ndetermine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be\nsustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or\nlitigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In\nevaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition\nthreshold, we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate\ntaxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The\nsecond step is measurement: a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not\nrecognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to\nrecognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the\nlargest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized\nupon ultimate settlement. Differences between tax positions taken in a tax\nreturn and amounts recognized in the financial statements will generally\nresult in one or more of the following: an increase in a liability for income\ntaxes payable, a reduction of an income tax refund receivable, a reduction in\na deferred tax asset or an increase in a deferred tax liability.\n\n  \n\nSignificant management judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions\nand in determining our effective tax rate.\n\n  \n\n65\n\n* * *\n\nTable of Contents\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based compensation\nawards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. See\nNote 10 for additional information.\n\n  \n\nForeign Currency Translation and Transactions\n\nThe functional currency of our foreign operations is generally the local\ncurrency. For these foreign entities, we translate their financial statements\ninto U.S. dollars using average exchange rates for the period for income\nstatement amounts and using end-of-period exchange rates for assets and\nliabilities. We record these translation adjustments in Accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss, a separate component of Equity, in our consolidated\nbalance sheets. We record exchange gains and losses resulting from the\nconversion of transaction currency to functional currency as a component of\nOther income (expense), net.\n\n  \n\nEmployee Benefit Plans", "Employee Benefit Plans\n\nPension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefits earned\nduring the year, as well as interest on projected benefit obligations, are\naccrued. Prior service costs and credits resulting from changes in plan\nbenefits are generally amortized over the average remaining service period of\nthe employees expected to receive benefits. Expected return on plan assets is\ndetermined by applying the return on assets assumption to the actual fair\nvalue of plan assets. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in Other\nincome (expense), net in the year in which they occur. These gains and losses\nare measured annually as of December 31 and upon a remeasurement event.\nVerizon management employees no longer earn pension benefits or earn service\ntowards the Company retiree medical subsidy. See Note 11 for additional\ninformation.\n\n  \n\nWe recognize a pension or a postretirement plan's funded status as either an\nasset or liability in the consolidated balance sheets. Also, we measure any\nunrecognized prior service costs and credits that arise during the period as a\ncomponent of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable\nincome tax.\n\n  \n\nDerivative Instruments\n\nWe enter into derivative transactions primarily to manage our exposure to\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We employ\nrisk management strategies, which may include the use of a variety of\nderivatives including cross currency swaps, forward starting interest rate\nswaps, interest rate swaps, treasury rate locks, interest rate caps, swaptions\nand foreign exchange forwards. We do not hold derivatives for trading\npurposes.\n\n  \n\nWe measure all derivatives at fair value and recognize them as either assets\nor liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Our derivative instruments\nare valued primarily using models based on readily observable market\nparameters for all substantial terms of our derivative contracts and thus are\nclassified as Level 2. Changes in the fair values of derivative instruments\napplied as economic hedges are recognized in earnings in the current period.\nFor fair value hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative\ninstruments is recognized in earnings, along with the change in the fair value\nof the hedged item. Unrealized gains or losses on excluded components of fair\nvalue hedges are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) and are\nrecognized into earnings on a systematic and rational basis through the swap\naccrual over the life of the hedged item. For cash flow hedges, the change in\nthe fair value of the derivative instruments is reported in Other\ncomprehensive income (loss) and recognized in earnings when the hedged item is\nrecognized in earnings. For net investment hedges of certain of our foreign\noperations, the change in the fair value of the hedging instruments is\nreported in Other comprehensive income (loss) as part of the cumulative\ntranslation adjustment and partially offsets the impact of foreign currency\nchanges on the value of our net investment.\n\n  \n\nCash flows from derivatives, which are designated as accounting hedges or\napplied as economic hedges, are presented consistently with the cash flow\nclassification of the related hedged items. See Note 9 for additional\ninformation.\n\n  \n\nVariable Interest Entities", "Variable Interest Entities\n\nVIEs are entities that lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance\nits activities without additional subordinated financial support from other\nparties, have equity investors that do not have the ability to make\nsignificant decisions relating to the entity's operations through voting\nrights, do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not\nhave the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. We consolidate\nthe assets and liabilities of VIEs when we are deemed to be the primary\nbeneficiary.

Revenue and Contract Costs  \n  \nWe earn revenue from contracts with customers, primarily through the provision\nof telecommunications and other services and through the sale of wireless\nequipment.\n\nRevenue by Category\n\nWe have two reportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic\nbusiness units, Consumer and Business. Revenue is disaggregated by products\nand services within Consumer, and customer groups (Enterprise and Public\nSector, Business Markets and Other, and Wholesale) within Business. See Note\n13 for additional information on revenue by segment, including Corporate and\nother.\n\n  \n\nWe also earn revenues that are not accounted for under Topic 606 from leasing\narrangements (such as those for towers and equipment), captive reinsurance\narrangements primarily related to wireless device insurance and the interest\nrecognized when equipment is sold to the customer by an authorized agent under\na device payment plan agreement. We have elected the practical expedient\nwithin Topic 842, to combine the lease and non-lease components for those\ncustomer arrangements under Topic 606 that involve customer premise equipment\nwhere we are the lessor. Revenues from arrangements that were not accounted\nfor under Topic 606 were approximately $3.1 billion, $2.9 billion and $3.2\nbillion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n  \n\nRemaining Performance Obligations", "Remaining Performance Obligations\n\nWhen allocating the total contract transaction price to identified performance\nobligations, a portion of the total transaction price may relate to service\nperformance obligations which were not satisfied or are partially satisfied as\nof the end of the reporting period. Below we disclose information relating to\nthese unsatisfied performance obligations. We apply the practical expedient\navailable under Topic 606 that provides the option to exclude the expected\nrevenues arising from unsatisfied performance obligations related to contracts\nthat have an original expected duration of one year or less. This situation\nprimarily arises with respect to certain month-to-month service contracts. At\nDecember 31, 2024, month-to-month service contracts represented approximately\n95% of both our wireless postpaid contracts and our wireline Consumer and our\nBusiness Markets and Other contracts, compared to December 31, 2023, for which\nmonth-to-month service contracts represented approximately 95% of our wireless\npostpaid contracts and 94% of our wireline Consumer and our Business Markets\nand Other contracts.\n\n  \n\nAdditionally, certain contracts provide customers the option to purchase\nadditional services. The fees related to these additional services are\nrecognized when the customer exercises the option (typically on a month-to-\nmonth basis).\n\n  \n\nContracts for wireless services, with or without promotional credits that\nrequire maintenance of service, are generally either month-to-month and\ncancellable at any time, or considered to contain terms ranging from greater\nthan one month to up to thirty-six months (typically under a device payment\nplan or a fixed-term plan). Additionally, customers may incur charges based on\nusage or additional optional services purchased in conjunction with entering\ninto a contract that can be cancelled at any time and therefore are not\nincluded in the transaction price. The transaction price allocated to service\nperformance obligations, which are not satisfied or are partially satisfied as\nof the end of the reporting period, are generally related to contracts that\nare not accounted for as month-to-month contracts.\n\n  \n\nOur Consumer group customers also include traditional wholesale resellers that\npurchase and resell wireless service under their own brands to their\nrespective customers. Reseller arrangements generally include a stated\ncontract term, which typically extends longer than two years and, in some\ncases, include a periodic minimum revenue commitment over the contract term\nfor which revenues will be recognized in future periods.\n\n  \n\nConsumer customer contracts for wireline services are generally month-to-\nmonth; however, they may have a service term of two years or shorter than\ntwelve months. Certain contracts with Business customers for wireline services\nextend into future periods, contain fixed monthly fees and usage-based fees,\nand can include annual commitments in each year of the contract or\n\n67\n\n* * *\n\nTable of Contents\n\ncommitments over the entire specified contract term; however, a significant\nnumber of contracts for wireline services with our Business customers have a\ncontract term that is twelve months or less.\n\n  \n\nAdditionally, there are certain contracts with Business customers for wireline\nservices that have a contractual minimum fee over the total contract term. We\ncannot predict the time period when revenue will be recognized related to\nthose contracts; thus, they are excluded from the time bands below. These\ncontracts have varying terms spanning over approximately twenty-nine years\nending in September 2053 and have aggregate contract minimum payments totaling\n$1.8 billion.", "At December 31, 2024, the transaction price related to unsatisfied performance\nobligations that are expected to be recognized for 2025, 2026 and thereafter\nwas $28.5 billion, $17.5 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively. Remaining\nperformance obligation estimates are subject to change and are affected by\nseveral factors, including terminations and changes in the timing and scope of\ncontracts, arising from contract modifications.\n\n  \n\nAccounts Receivable and Contract Balances\n\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the time of billing to our\ncustomers. Receivables presented in our consolidated balance sheets represent\nan unconditional right to consideration. Contract balances represent amounts\nfrom an arrangement when either Verizon has performed, by transferring goods\nor services to the customer in advance of receiving all or partial\nconsideration for such goods and services from the customer, or the customer\nhas made payment to Verizon in advance of obtaining control of the goods\nand/or services promised to the customer in the contract.\n\n  \n\nThe following table presents information about receivables from contracts with\ncustomers:\n\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n| At December 31,| | | | At December 31,| |   \n(dollars in millions)| 2024| | | | 2023| |   \nAccounts Receivable(1)| $| 9,225 | | | | | $| 9,760 | | |   \nDevice payment plan agreement receivables(2)| 19,766 | | | | | 18,528 | | |   \n  \n(1) Balances do not include receivables related to the following: activity\nassociated with certain vendor agreements, leasing arrangements (such as those\nfor towers and equipment), captive reinsurance arrangements primarily related\nto wireless device insurance and device payment plan agreement receivables\npresented separately.\n\n(2) Included in device payment plan agreement receivables presented in Note 8.\nReceivables derived from the sale of equipment on a device payment plan\nthrough an authorized agent are excluded.\n\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n| | | | | | |   \n| | | | | | |   \n| | | | | | |   \n| | | | | | |   \n| | | | | | |   \n| | | | | | |   \n| | | | | | |   \n  \nContract assets primarily relate to our rights to consideration for goods or\nservices provided to customers but for which we do not have an unconditional\nright at the reporting date. Under a fixed-term plan, total contract revenue\nis allocated between wireless service and equipment revenues. In conjunction\nwith these arrangements, a contract asset is created, which represents the\ndifference between the amount of equipment revenue recognized upon sale and\nthe amount of consideration received from the customer when the performance\nobligation related to the transfer of control of the equipment is satisfied.\nThe contract asset is reclassified to accounts receivable as wireless services\nare provided and billed. We have the right to bill the customer as service is\nprovided over time, which results in our right to the payment being\nunconditional. The contract asset balances are presented in our consolidated\nbalance sheets as Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets. We recognize\nthe allowance for credit losses at inception and reassess quarterly based on\nmanagement's expectation of the asset's collectability.\n\n  \n\nContract assets increased $128 million during the year ended December 31,\n2024. The change in contract assets was primarily due to new contracts and\nincreases in sales promotions recognized upfront, driven by customer activity\nrelated to wireless and Fios services. These items were partially offset by\nreclassifications to accounts receivable due to billings on existing contracts\nand impairment charges of $53 million.", "Contract liabilities arise when we bill our customers and receive\nconsideration in advance of providing the goods or services promised in the\ncontract. We typically bill service one month in advance, which is the primary\ncomponent of the contract liability balance. Contract liabilities are\nrecognized as revenue when services are provided to the customer. The contract\nliability balances are presented in our consolidated balance sheets as Other\ncurrent liabilities and Other liabilities.\n\n  \n\nContract liabilities increased $776 million during the year ended December 31,\n2024. The change in contract liabilities was primarily due to increases in\nsales promotions recognized over time, upfront fees and wireless pricing\nactions.\n\n  \n\nRevenue recognized during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 related\nto contract liabilities existing at January 1, 2024 and 2023 were $5.0 billion\nand $4.9 billion, respectively, as performance obligations related to services\nwere satisfied.\n\n  \n\n68\n\n* * *\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe balance of contract assets and contract liabilities recorded in our\nconsolidated balance sheets were as follows:\n\n| | | | | | | | | | |   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n  \n| At December 31,| | At December 31,  \n(dollars in millions)| 2024| | 2023  \nAssets| | |   \nPrepaid expenses and other| $| 621 | | | $| 546 |   \nOther assets| 321 | | | 268 |   \nTotal Contract Assets| $| 942 | | | $| 814 |   \n| | |   \nLiabilities| | |   \nOther current liabilities| $| 7,492 | | | $| 6,955 |   \nOther liabilities| 2,186 | | | 1,947 |   \nTotal Contract Liabilities| $| 9,678 | | | $| 8,902 |   \n  \n  \n\nContract Costs\n\nAs discussed in Note 1, Topic 606 requires the recognition of an asset for\nincremental costs to obtain a customer contract, which are then amortized to\nexpense over the respective periods of expected benefit. We recognize an asset\nfor incremental commission expenses paid to internal and external sales\npersonnel and agents in conjunction with obtaining customer contracts. We only\ndefer these costs when we have determined the commissions are incremental\ncosts that would not have been incurred absent the customer contract and are\nexpected to be recoverable. Costs to obtain a contract are amortized and\nrecorded ratably as commission expense over the period representing the\ntransfer of goods or services to which the assets relate. Costs to obtain\nwireless contracts are amortized over both of our Consumer and Business\ncustomers' estimated upgrade cycles, as such costs are typically incurred each\ntime a customer upgrades. Costs to obtain wireline contracts are amortized as\nexpense over the estimated customer relationship period for our Consumer\ncustomers. Incremental costs to obtain wireline contracts for our Business\ncustomers are insignificant. Costs to obtain contracts are recorded in\nSelling, general and administrative expense.\n\n  \n\nWe also defer costs incurred to fulfill contracts that: (1) relate directly to\nthe contract; (2) are expected to generate resources that will be used to\nsatisfy our performance obligation under the contract; and (3) are expected to\nbe recovered through revenue generated under the contract. Contract\nfulfillment costs are expensed as we satisfy our performance obligations and\nrecorded in Cost of services. These costs principally relate to direct costs\nthat enhance our wireline business resources, such as costs incurred to\ninstall circuits.\n\n  \n\nWe determine the amortization periods for our costs incurred to obtain or\nfulfill a customer contract at a portfolio level due to the similarities\nwithin these customer contract portfolios.\n\n  \n\nOther costs, such as general costs or costs related to past performance\nobligations, are expensed as incurred.", "Other costs, such as general costs or costs related to past performance\nobligations, are expensed as incurred.\n\n  \n\nCollectively, costs to obtain a contract and costs to fulfill a contract are\nreferred to as deferred contract costs, and amortized over a two-to-seven year\nperiod. Deferred contract costs are classified as current or non-current\nwithin Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets, respectively.\n\n  \n\nThe balances of deferred contract costs included in our consolidated balance\nsheets were as follows:\n\n| | | | | | | | | | |   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n  \n| At December 31,| | At December 31,  \n(dollars in millions)| 2024| | 2023  \nAssets| | |   \nPrepaid expenses and other| $| 2,932 | | | $| 2,756 |   \nOther assets| 2,808 | | | 2,639 |   \nTotal| $| 5,740 | | | $| 5,395 |   \n  \n  \n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recognized expense of $3.4\nbillion and $3.2 billion, respectively, associated with the amortization of\ndeferred contract costs, primarily within Selling, general and administrative\nexpense in our consolidated statements of income.\n\n  \n\nWe assess our deferred contract costs for impairment on a quarterly basis. We\nrecognize an impairment charge to the extent the carrying amount of a deferred\ncost exceeds the remaining amount of consideration we expect to receive in\nexchange for the goods and services related to the cost, less the expected\ncosts related directly to providing those goods and services that have not yet\nbeen recognized as expenses. There were no impairment charges recognized for\nthe year ended December 31, 2024.

During 2024, 2023 and 2022,\nwe made payments of $269 million, $4.3 billion and $1.6 billion respectively,\nfor obligations related to clearing costs and accelerated clearing incentives.\nThe carrying value of the wireless spectrum won in Auction 107 consists of all\npayments required to participate and purchase licenses in the auction,\nincluding Verizon's allocable share of clearing costs incurred by, and\nincentive payments due to, the incumbent license holders associated with the\nauction that we are obligated to pay in order to acquire the licenses, as well\nas capitalized interest to the extent qualifying activities have occurred.\n\n  \n\nIn March 2022, Verizon signed agreements with satellite operators in which\noperators agreed to clear C-Band spectrum in certain markets and frequencies\nahead of the previously expected timeframe. During 2022, Verizon incurred\ncosts associated with these agreements of approximately $340 million, of which\n$310 million was paid as of December 31, 2022 and the remainder was paid in\n2023. This early clearance accelerated Verizon's access to more spectrum in a\nnumber of key markets to support its 5G network initiatives.\n\n  \n\nOn October 17, 2024, Verizon entered into a license purchase agreement to\nacquire select spectrum licenses of United States Cellular Corporation and\ncertain of its subsidiaries (UScellular) for total consideration of $1.0\nbillion, subject to certain potential adjustments.

These\npressures resulted in lower projected cash flows primarily driven by secular\ndeclines in wireline services and products across our Business customer\ngroups. In connection with Verizon's annual budget process in the fourth\nquarter of 2023, leadership completed a comprehensive five-year strategic\nplanning review of our Business reporting unit resulting in declines in\nfinancial projections driven by market dynamics as compared to the prior year\nfive-year strategic planning cycle. The revised projections were used as a key\ninput into the Business reporting unit's annual goodwill impairment test\nperformed in the fourth quarter of 2023. In addition, changes in the\nmacroeconomic environment, including interest rate and inflationary pressures\nalso impacted the fair value of the reporting unit.

In addition, the\nBusiness reporting unit has continued to experience competitive and market\npressures throughout 2024, that may persist over the near term. We applied a\ncombination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method reflecting\ncurrent assumptions and inputs, including our revised projections, discount\nrate and expected growth rates, which indicated that the fair value of our\nBusiness reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, did not\nresult in an impairment. We do not anticipate reasonable changes in\nsignificant assumptions to change the outcome of the quantitative impairment\nassessment. However, management believes there is a continued risk that our\nBusiness reporting unit may be required to recognize an impairment charge in\nthe future.\n\n  \n\nA projected sustained decline in the reporting unit's revenues and earnings\ncould have a significant negative impact on its fair value and could result in\nimpairment charges. Such a decline could be driven by, among other things: (1)\ndecreases in sales volumes or long-term growth rate as a result of competitive\npressures or other factors; or (2) the inability to achieve or delays in\nachieving the goals in strategic initiatives. Adverse changes to macroeconomic\nfactors, such as increases in long-term interest rates, would also negatively\nimpact the fair value of the reporting unit.\n\n  \n\nOther Intangible Assets\n\nThe following table displays the composition of Other intangible assets, net\nas well as the respective amortization period:", "Other Intangible Assets\n\nThe following table displays the composition of Other intangible assets, net\nas well as the respective amortization period:\n\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n| | | | | | | (dollars in millions)  \n| | | | | 2024| | | | | | 2023  \nAt December 31,| Gross  \nAmount| | Accumulated  \nAmortization| | Net  \nAmount| | GrossAmount| | Accumulated  \nAmortization| | Net  \nAmount  \nCustomer lists (5 to 13 years)| $| 4,242 | | | $| (2,629)| | | $| 1,613 | | | $| 4,335 | | | $| (2,193)| | | $| 2,142 |   \nNon-network internal-use software (3 to 7 years)| 28,136 | | | (19,743)| | | 8,393 | | | 25,524 | | | (17,949)| | | 7,575 |   \nOther (4 to 25 years)| 2,664 | | | (1,541)| | | 1,123 | | | 2,656 | | | (1,316)| | | 1,340 |   \nTotal| $| 35,042 | | | $| (23,913)| | | $| 11,129 | | | $| 32,515 | | | $| (21,458)| | | $| 11,057 |   \n  \n  \n\nThe amortization expense for Other intangible assets was as follows:\n\n| | | | |   \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nYears| (dollars in millions)  \n2024| $| 2,781 |   \n2023| 2,687 |   \n2022| 2,507 |   \n  \n  \n\nEstimated annual amortization expense for Other intangible assets is as\nfollows:\n\n| | | | |   \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nYears| (dollars in millions)  \n2025| $| 2,825 |   \n2026| 2,571 |   \n2027| 2,025 |   \n2028| 1,549 |   \n2029| 887 |   \n  \n  \n\n| |   \n---|---|---  \nNote 5.

Leasing Arrangements  \n  \nWe enter into various lease arrangements for network equipment including\ntowers, distributed antenna systems, small cells, real estate and connectivity\nmediums including dark fiber, equipment, and other various types of assets for\nuse in our operations. Our leases have remaining lease terms ranging from 1\nyear to 30 years, some of which include options that we can elect to extend\nthe leases term for up to 25 years, and some of which include options to\nterminate the leases. For the majority of leases entered into during the\ncurrent period, we have concluded it is not reasonably certain that we would\nexercise the options to extend the lease or not terminate the lease.\nTherefore, as of the lease commencement date, our lease terms generally do not\ninclude these options. We include options to extend the lease when it is\nreasonably certain that we will exercise that option.", "During December 2024, we completed a transaction with Vertical Bridge REIT,\nLLC (Vertical Bridge) pursuant to which Vertical Bridge obtained the exclusive\nrights to lease, operate and manage over 6,000 wireless towers from Verizon in\nexchange for an upfront payment of $2.8 billion. Under the terms of the\nagreement, Vertical Bridge has exclusive rights to lease, operate and manage\nthe towers over an average term of approximately 30 years, with the option to\nacquire the towers at the end of the lease terms. We have leased back a\nportion of the capacity on the towers from Vertical Bridge for an initial term\nof 10 years, with eight optional renewal terms of five years each, subject to\ncertain early termination rights. We continue to include the towers in\nProperty, plant and equipment, net in our consolidated balance sheets and\ndepreciate them accordingly. The upfront payment, which is primarily included\nwithin Other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, is accounted for\nas prepaid rent and as a financing obligation. We recorded prepaid rent of\n$2.0 billion related to the portion of the towers for which the right-of-use\nhas passed to Vertical Bridge, which is reflected in Cash flows from operating\nactivities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. In addition, we\nrecorded a financing obligation of $830 million related to the portion of the\ntowers that we continue to occupy and use for network operations, which is\nreflected in Cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated\nstatements of cash flows.\n\n  \n\nDuring March 2015, we completed a transaction with American Tower Corporation\n(American Tower) pursuant to which American Tower acquired the exclusive\nrights to lease and operate approximately 11,300 of our wireless towers for an\nupfront payment of $5.0 billion. We have subleased capacity on the towers from\nAmerican Tower for a minimum of 10 years at current market rates in 2015, with\noptions to renew. We continue to include the towers in Property, plant and\nequipment, net in our consolidated balance sheets and depreciate them\naccordingly.\n\n  \n\nIn addition to the rights to lease and operate the towers, Vertical Bridge and\nAmerican Tower assumed the interest in the underlying ground leases related to\nthese towers.

When a\ncustomer enters into a device payment plan agreement with the right to upgrade\nto a new device, we account for this trade-in right as a guarantee obligation.\n\n  \n\nWe may offer certain promotions that allow a customer to trade in their owned\ndevice in connection with the purchase of a new device. Under these types of\npromotions, the customer receives a credit for the value of the trade-in\ndevice. At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amount of trade-in\nliability was $396 million and $566 million, respectively.\n\n  \n\nIn addition, we may provide the customer with additional future billing\ncredits that will be applied against the customer's monthly bill as long as\nservice is maintained. These future billing credits are accounted for as\nconsideration payable to a customer and are included in the determination of\ntotal transaction price, resulting in a contract liability.\n\n  \n\nDevice payment plan agreement receivables, net, disclosed in the table above,\ndoes not reflect the trade-in liability, additional future credits or the\nguarantee liability.\n\n  \n\nOrigination of Device Payment Plan Agreements\n\nWhen originating device payment plan agreements, we use internal and external\ndata sources to create a credit risk score to measure the credit quality of a\ncustomer and to determine eligibility for the device payment program.\nVerizon's experience has been that the payment attributes of longer tenured\ncustomers are highly predictive for estimating their reliability to make\nfuture payments. Customers with longer tenures tend to exhibit similar risk\ncharacteristics to other customers with longer tenures, and receivables due\nfrom customers with longer tenures tend to perform better than receivables\nfrom customers that have not\n\n81\n\n* * *\n\nTable of Contents\n\npreviously been Verizon customers. As a result of this experience, we make\ninitial lending decisions based upon whether the customers are \"established\ncustomers\" or \"short-tenured customers.\" If a Consumer customer has been a\ncustomer for 45 days or more, or if a Business customer has been a customer\nfor 12 months or more, the customer is considered an \"established customer.\"\nFor established customers, the credit decision and ongoing credit monitoring\nprocesses rely on a combination of internal and external data sources. If a\nConsumer customer has been a customer less than 45 days, or a Business\ncustomer has been a customer for less than 12 months, the customer is\nconsidered a \"short-tenured customer.\" For short-tenured customers, the credit\ndecision and credit monitoring processes rely more heavily on external data\nsources.\n\n  \n\nAvailable external credit data from credit reporting agencies along with\ninternal data are used to create custom credit risk scores for Consumer\ncustomers. The custom credit risk score is generated automatically from the\napplicant's credit data using proprietary custom credit models. The credit\nrisk score measures the likelihood that the potential customer will become\nseverely delinquent and be disconnected for non-payment. For a small portion\nof short-tenured customer applications, a traditional credit report is not\navailable from one of the national credit reporting agencies because the\npotential customer does not have sufficient credit history. In those\ninstances, alternative credit data is used for the risk assessment. For\nBusiness customers, we also verify the existence of the business with external\ndata sources.", "Based on the custom credit risk score, we assign each customer a credit class,\neach of which has specified offers of credit. This includes an account level\nspending limit and a maximum amount of credit allowed per device for Consumer\ncustomers or a required down payment percentage for Business customers.\n\n  \n\nCredit Quality Information\n\nSubsequent to origination, we assess indicators for the quality of our\nwireless device payment plan agreement portfolio using two models, one for new\ncustomers and one for existing customers. The model for new customers pools\nall Consumer and Business wireless customers based on less than 210 days as\n\"new customers.\" The model for existing customers pools all Consumer and\nBusiness wireless customers based on 210 days or more as \"existing customers.\"\n\n  \n\nThe following table presents device payment plan agreement receivables, at\namortized cost, and gross write-offs recorded, as of and for the twelve months\nended December 31, 2024, by credit quality indicator and year of origination:\n\n  \n\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n| Year of Origination(1)| |   \n(dollars in millions)| 2024| | 2023| | 2022 and prior| | Total  \nDevice payment plan agreement receivables, at amortized cost| | | | | | |   \nNew customers| $| 3,277 | | | $| 1,542 | | | $| 397 | | | $| 5,216 |   \nExisting customers| 14,136 | | | 8,075 | | | 2,906 | | | 25,117 |   \nTotal| $| 17,413 | | | $| 9,617 | | | $| 3,303 | | | $| 30,333 |   \nGross write-offs| | | | | | |   \nNew customers| $| 376 | | | $| 563 | | | $| 111 | | | $| 1,050 |   \nExisting customers| 52 | | | 201 | | | 155 | | | 408 |   \nTotal| $| 428 | | | $| 764 | | | $| 266 | | | $| 1,458 |   \n  \n(1) Includes accounts that have been suspended at a point in time.\n\n  \n\nThe data presented in the table above was last updated on December 31, 2024.\n\n  \n\nWe assess indicators for the quality of our wireless service receivables\nportfolio as one overall pool.

Wireline service receivables are disaggregated and pooled by the\nfollowing types of customers and related contracts: consumer, small and medium\nbusiness, enterprise, public sector and wholesale. For wireless service\nreceivables and wireline consumer and small and medium business receivables,\nthe allowance is calculated based on a 12 month rolling average write-off\nbalance multiplied by the average life-cycle of an account from billing to\nwrite-off. The risk of loss is assessed over the contractual life of the\nreceivables and is adjusted based on the historical loss amounts for current\nand future conditions based on management's qualitative considerations.

Since our customers' behaviors may be impacted\nby general economic conditions, we analyzed whether changes in macroeconomic\nconditions impact our credit loss experience and have concluded that our\ncredit loss estimates are generally not materially impacted by reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts of future economic conditions. Based on the score\nderived from these models, accounts are grouped by risk category to determine\nthe collection strategy to be applied to such accounts. For device payment\nplan agreement receivables and wireless service receivables, we consider an\naccount to be delinquent and in default status if there are unpaid charges\nremaining on the account on the day after the bill's due date. The risk class\ndetermines the speed and severity of the collections effort including\ninitiatives taken to facilitate customer payment.\n\n  \n\nThe balance and aging of the device payment plan agreement receivables, at\namortized cost, were as follows:\n\n| | | | | | | | |   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n| | | | |   \n(dollars in millions)| At December 31, 2024| | | |   \nUnbilled| $| 28,916 | | | | |   \nBilled:| | | | |   \nCurrent| 1,116 | | | | |   \nPast due| 301 | | | | |   \nDevice payment plan agreement receivables, at amortized cost| $| 30,333 | | | | |   \n  \n  \n\n83\n\n* * *\n\nTable of Contents\n\n| |   \n---|---|---  \nNote 9.

We principally receive fixed rates and pay variable rates,\nresulting in a net increase or decrease to Interest expense. These swaps are\ndesignated as fair value hedges and hedge against interest rate risk exposure\nof designated debt issuances. We record the interest rate swaps at fair value\nin our consolidated balance sheets as assets and liabilities. Changes in the\nfair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded to Interest expense, which\nare primarily offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged debt due to\nchanges in interest rates.\n\n  \n\nCross Currency Swaps\n\nWe have entered into cross currency swaps to exchange our British Pound\nSterling, Euro, Swiss Franc, Canadian Dollar and Australian Dollar-denominated\ncash flows into U.S. dollars and to fix our cash payments in U.S. dollars, as\nwell as to mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or\nlosses. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges. We record the cross\ncurrency swaps at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets as assets and\nliabilities. Changes in the fair value of the cross currency swaps\nattributable to changes in the spot rate of the hedged item and changes in the\nrecorded value of the hedged debt due to changes in spot rates are recorded in\nthe same income statement line item. We present exchange gains and losses from\nthe conversion of foreign currency denominated debt as a part of Interest\nexpense. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, these amounts\ncompletely offset each other and no net gain or loss was recorded.\n\n  \n\nChanges in the fair value of cross currency swaps attributable to time value\nand cross currency basis spread are initially recorded to Other comprehensive\nincome (loss).

The amount remaining in Accumulated other comprehensive\nloss related to cash flow hedges on the date of transition will be\nreclassified to earnings when the hedged item is recognized in earnings or\nwhen it becomes probable that the forecasted transactions will not occur. For\nthe fair value hedges, we elected to exclude the change in fair value of the\ncross currency swaps related to both time value and cross currency basis\nspread from the assessment of hedge effectiveness (the excluded components).\nThe initial value of the excluded components of $1.0 billion as of March 31,\n2022 will continue to be amortized into Interest expense over the remaining\nlife of the hedging instruments. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and\n2023, the amortization of the initial value of the excluded component\ncompletely offset the amortization related to the amount remaining in Other\ncomprehensive income (loss) related to cash flow hedges. See Note 14 for\nadditional information. We estimate that $94 million will be amortized into\nInterest expense within the next 12 months.\n\n  \n\nTreasury Rate Locks\n\nWe enter into treasury rate locks designated as cash flow hedges to mitigate\nour interest rate risk on future transactions. We recognize gains and losses\nresulting from interest rate movements in Other comprehensive income (loss).\n\n  \n\nNet Investment Hedges\n\nWe have designated certain foreign currency debt instruments as net investment\nhedges to mitigate foreign exchange exposure related to non-U.S. dollar net\ninvestments in certain foreign subsidiaries against changes in foreign\nexchange rates.

The CSA agreements contain fixed cap amounts or rating based\nthresholds such that we or our counterparties may be required to hold or post\ncollateral based upon changes in outstanding positions as compared to\nestablished thresholds or caps and changes in credit ratings. We do not offset\nfair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments and fair value\namounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation\nto return cash collateral arising from derivative instruments recognized at\nfair value. At both December 31, 2024 and 2023, we did not hold any\ncollateral. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, we posted $2.1 billion and $1.4\nbillion, respectively, of collateral related to derivative contracts under\ncollateral exchange agreements, which were recorded as Prepaid expenses and\nother in our consolidated balance sheets. While we may be exposed to credit\nlosses due to the nonperformance of our counterparties, we consider the risk\nremote and do not expect that any such nonperformance would result in a\nsignificant effect on our results of operations or financial condition due to\nour diversified pool of counterparties.\n\n  \n\n| |   \n---|---|---  \nNote 10. Stock-Based Compensation  \n  \nVerizon Long-Term Incentive Plan\n\nIn May 2017, our shareholders approved the 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the\n2017 Plan) and terminated the Company's authority to grant new awards under\nthe Verizon 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2009 Plan). The 2017 Plan\nprovides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive\nofficers, and permits the granting of stock options, stock appreciation\nrights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares,\nperformance stock units and other awards. Upon approval of the 2017 Plan, we\nreserved for issuance under the 2017 Plan the number of shares that were\nremaining but not issued under the 2009 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding\nawards under the 2009 Plan that expire, are canceled or otherwise terminated\nwill also be available for awards under the 2017 Plan. As of December 31,\n2024, 50 million shares are reserved for future issuance under the 2017 Plan.\n\n  \n\nRestricted Stock Units", "Restricted Stock Units\n\nRestricted Stock Units (RSUs) granted under the 2017 Plan generally vest in\nthree equal installments on each anniversary of the grant date. The RSUs that\nare paid in stock upon vesting and are thus classified as equity awards are\nmeasured using the grant date fair value of Verizon common stock and are not\nremeasured at the end of each reporting period. In 2020, Verizon announced a\nbroad-based program that provides for the annual award of cash-settled RSUs\nunder the 2017 Plan to all full-time and part-time employees who meet\neligibility requirements. The RSUs that are settled in cash are classified as\nliability awards and the liability is measured at its fair value at the end of\neach reporting period. All RSUs granted under the 2017 Plan have dividend\nequivalent units (DEUs), which will be paid to participants if, and only to\nthe extent the applicable RSU award vests, and is paid at the time the RSU\naward is paid, and in the same proportion as the RSU award.\n\n  \n\nWe estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in\nsubsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use\nhistorical data to estimate forfeitures and recognize that estimated\ncompensation cost of restricted stock units, net of estimated forfeitures, on\na straight-line basis over the vesting period.\n\n  \n\nPerformance Stock Units\n\nThe 2017 Plan also provides for grants of Performance Stock Units (PSUs) that\ngenerally vest at the end of the third year after the grant. As defined by the\n2017 Plan, the Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors determines\nthe number of PSUs a participant earns based on the extent to which the\ncorresponding performance goals have been achieved over the three-year\nperformance cycle.

short-term investment funds (less than 90\ndays to maturity), primarily in diversified portfolios of investment grade\nmoney market instruments and are valued using quoted market prices or other\nvaluation methods. The carrying value of cash equivalents approximates fair\nvalue due to the short-term nature of these investments.\n\n  \n\nInvestments in securities traded on national and foreign securities exchanges\nare valued by the trustee at the last reported sale prices on the last\nbusiness day of the year or, if no sales were reported on that date, at the\nlast reported bid prices. Government obligations, corporate bonds,\ninternational bonds and asset-backed debt are valued using matrix prices with\ninput from independent third-party valuation sources. Over-the-counter\nsecurities are valued at the bid prices or the average of the bid and ask\nprices on the last business day of the year from published sources or, if not\navailable, from other sources considered reliable such as multiple broker\nquotes.\n\n  \n\nCommingled funds not traded on national exchanges are priced by the custodian\nor fund's administrator at their net asset value (NAV). Commingled funds held\nby third-party custodians appointed by the fund managers provide the fund\nmanagers with a NAV. The fund managers have the responsibility for providing\nthis information to the custodian of the respective plan.", "The investment manager of the entity values venture capital, corporate finance\nand natural resource limited partnership investments. Real estate investments\nare valued at amounts based upon appraisal reports prepared by either\nindependent real estate appraisers or the investment manager using discounted\ncash flows or market comparable data. Loans secured by mortgages are carried\nat the lesser of the unpaid balance or appraised value of the underlying\nproperties. The values assigned to these investments are based upon available\nand current market information and do not necessarily represent amounts that\nmight ultimately be realized. Because of the inherent uncertainty of\nvaluation, estimated fair values might differ significantly from the values\nthat would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed. These\ndifferences could be material.\n\n  \n\nForward currency contracts, futures, and options are valued by the trustee at\nthe exchange rates and market prices prevailing on the last business day of\nthe year. Both exchange rates and market prices are readily available from\npublished sources. These securities are classified by the asset class of the\nunderlying holdings.\n\n  \n\nHedge funds are valued by the custodian at NAV based on statements received\nfrom the investment manager. These funds are valued in accordance with the\nterms of their corresponding offering or private placement memoranda.\n\n  \n\nCommingled funds, hedge funds, venture capital, corporate finance, natural\nresource and real estate limited partnership investments for which fair value\nis measured using the NAV per share as a practical expedient are not leveled\nwithin the fair value hierarchy but are included in total investments.\n\n  \n\nEmployer Contributions\n\nIn 2024, we made discretionary contributions in the aggregate amount of $365\nmillion to the Pension Plans, $56 million of contributions to our nonqualified\npension plans and $935 million of contributions to our other postretirement\nbenefit plans.

We measure and evaluate our reportable\nsegments based on segment operating income, consistent with the chief\noperating decision maker's (CODM) assessment of segment performance.", "The Company's CODM is the Chief Executive Officer. The CODM uses segment\noperating income to allocate resources (including employees, financial or\ncapital resources) and to assess performance during the monthly and quarterly\nfinancial strategic review process. When assessing segment performance and how\nto allocate resources, the CODM focuses on evaluating whether revenues\ngenerated are sufficient to cover variable and fixed costs with an appropriate\nreturn on investment. Key decisions considered by the CODM using segment\noperating income include prioritization and timing of changes to network\ntechnologies, allocation of capital expenditures based on the Company's\npriorities, geographic expansion of wireline and wireless networks,\nestablishment of key financial and operational targets, pricing decisions,\nbranding matters and people management.\n\n  \n\nOur segments and their principal activities consist of the following:\n\n99\n\n* * *\n\nTable of Contents\n\n| | | | | | | |   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nSegment| | Description  \nVerizon Consumer Group| | Our Consumer segment provides consumer-focused wireless and wireline communications services and products. Our wireless services are provided across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the U.S. under the Verizon family of brands and through wholesale and other arrangements. We also provide FWA broadband through our 5G or 4G LTE networks as an alternative to traditional landline internet access. Our wireline services are provided in nine states in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern U.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our 100% fiber-optic network through our Verizon Fios product portfolio and over a traditional copper-based network to customers who are not served by Fios.   \n| |   \nVerizon  \nBusiness Group| | Our Business segment provides wireless and wireline communications services and products, including FWA broadband, data, video and advanced communication services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network services, local and long distance voice services and network access to deliver various IoT services and products. We provide these products and services to businesses, public sector customers and wireless and wireline carriers across the U.S. and a subset of these products and services to customers around the world.  \n  \n  \n\nOur Consumer segment's wireless and wireline products and services are\navailable to our retail customers, as well as resellers that purchase wireless\nnetwork access from us on a wholesale basis. Our Business segment's wireless\nand wireline products and services are organized by the primary customer\ngroups for these offerings: Enterprise and Public Sector, Business Markets and\nOther, and Wholesale.\n\n  \n\nCorporate and other primarily includes device insurance programs, investments\nin unconsolidated businesses and development stage businesses that support our\nstrategic initiatives, as well as unallocated corporate expenses, certain\npension and other employee benefit related costs and interest and financing\nexpenses. Corporate and other also includes the historical results of divested\nbusinesses and other adjustments and gains and losses that are not allocated\nor used in assessing segment performance due to their nature. Although such\ntransactions are excluded from the business segment results, they are included\nin reported consolidated earnings. Gains and losses from these transactions\nthat are not individually significant are included in segment results and\ntherefore included in the CODM's assessment of segment performance.\n\n  \n\nThe following tables provide operating financial information for our two\nreportable segments:", "The following tables provide operating financial information for our two\nreportable segments:\n\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n| (dollars in millions)  \n2024| Consumer| | Business| | Total   \nReportable  \nSegments  \nExternal Operating Revenues| | | | |   \nService| $| 76,880 | | | $| -- | | | $| 76,880 |   \nWireless equipment| 19,598 | | | -- | | | 19,598 |   \nOther(1)| 6,213 | | | -- | | | 6,213 |   \n| | | | |   \nEnterprise and Public Sector| -- | | | 14,218 | | | 14,218 |   \nBusiness Markets and Other| -- | | | 13,081 | | | 13,081 |   \nWholesale| -- | | | 2,196 | | | 2,196 |   \nIntersegment revenues| 213 | | | 36 | | | 249 |   \nTotal Operating Revenues(2)| 102,904 | | | 29,531 | | | 132,435 |   \n| | | | |   \nOperating Expenses(3)| | | | |   \nCost of wireless equipment| 21,259 | | | 4,841 | | | 26,100 |   \nCentrally managed network and shared service costs(4) | 17,781 | | | 10,200 | | | 27,981 |   \nDepreciation and amortization expense| 13,552 | | | 4,307 | | | 17,859 |   \nOther segment expenses(5)| 20,828 | | | 8,125 | | | 28,953 |   \nTotal Operating Expenses| 73,420 | | | 27,473 | | | 100,893 |   \nOperating Income| $| 29,484 | | | $| 2,058 | | | $| 31,542 |   \n  \n(1) Other revenue includes fees that partially recover the direct and indirect\ncosts of complying with regulatory and industry obligations and programs,\nrevenues associated with certain products included in our device protection\nofferings, leasing and interest recognized when equipment is sold to the\ncustomer by an authorized agent under a device payment plan agreement.\n\n(2) Service and other revenues and Wireless equipment revenues included in our\nBusiness segment amounted to approximately $25.9 billion and $3.6 billion,\nrespectively, for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\n(3) The significant expense categories and amounts align with the segment-\nlevel information that is regularly provided to the CODM.

Equity and Comprehensive Income (Loss)  \n  \nEquity\n\nCommon Stock\n\nIn February 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a share\nbuyback program to repurchase up to 100 million shares of our common stock.\nThe program will terminate when the aggregate number of shares purchased\nreaches 100 million or a new share repurchase plan superseding the current\nplan is authorized, whichever is sooner. During the years ended December 31,\n2024, 2023, and 2022, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock\nunder our authorized share buyback program. At December 31, 2024, the maximum\nnumber of shares that could be purchased by or on behalf of Verizon under our\nshare buyback program was 100 million.\n\n  \n\nCommon stock has been used from time to time to satisfy some of the funding\nrequirements of employee and shareholder plans. During the years ended\nDecember 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we issued 5.4 million, 4.4 million and 2.1\nmillion shares of common stock from treasury stock, which had aggregate values\nof $238 million, $192 million and $91 million, respectively.\n\n  \n\nNoncontrolling Interests", "Noncontrolling Interests\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, Verizon entered into and completed\nagreements to acquire additional interests in certain controlled entities for\ncash consideration of $280 million.

The eligible\nsuppliers negotiate the terms directly with the financial institution and we\nhave no involvement in establishing those terms nor are we a party to these\nagreements.\n\n  \n\nOur payments associated with the invoices from the suppliers participating in\nthe SFP are made to the financial institution according to the original\ninvoice terms generally at 90 days from the invoice date and for the original\ninvoice amount. No additional payments are exchanged between Verizon and the\nfinancial institution related to the SFP. Verizon does not pledge any assets\nnor provide any guarantees to the financial institution in connection with the\nSFP. The SFP can be terminated by Verizon or the financial institution with a\n60-day notice period.\n\n  \n\nThe following table presents the confirmed obligations in the SFP and the\nrelated activities:\n\n| | | | | | | | |   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n| (dollars in millions)  \nYear Ended December 31,| 2024| | | |   \nConfirmed obligations outstanding at the beginning of the year| $| 817 | | | | |   \nInvoices added during the year| 3,549 | | | | |   \nInvoices paid during the year| (3,594)| | | | |   \nConfirmed obligations outstanding at the end of year| $| 772 | | | | |   \n  \n  \n\nConfirmed obligations outstanding related to suppliers participating in the\nSFP are recorded within Accounts payable and accrued liabilities in our\nconsolidated balance sheets and the associated payments are reflected in the\noperating activities section of our consolidated statements of cash flows. As\nof December 31, 2024 and 2023, $772 million and $817 million, respectively,\nremained as confirmed obligations outstanding related to suppliers\nparticipating in the SFP.", "| |   \n---|---|---  \nNote 16. Commitments and Contingencies  \n  \nIn the ordinary course of business, Verizon is involved in various litigation\nand regulatory proceedings at the state and federal level. Where it is\ndetermined, in consultation with counsel based on litigation and settlement\nrisks, that a loss is probable and estimable in a given matter, Verizon\nestablishes an accrual. In none of the currently pending matters is the amount\nof accrual material. An estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of\nloss in excess of the amounts already accrued cannot be made at this time due\nto various factors typical in contested proceedings, including: (1) uncertain\ndamage theories and demands; (2) a less than complete factual record; (3)\nuncertainty concerning legal theories and their resolution by courts or\nregulators; and (4) the unpredictable nature of the opposing party and its\ndemands. We continuously monitor these proceedings as they develop and adjust\nany accrual or disclosure as needed. We do not expect that the ultimate\nresolution of any pending regulatory or legal matter in future periods will\nhave a material effect on our financial condition, but it could have a\nmaterial effect on our results of operations for a given reporting period.\n\n  \n\nVerizon is currently involved in approximately 30 federal district court\nactions alleging that Verizon is infringing various patents. Most of these\ncases are brought by non-practicing entities and effectively seek only\nmonetary damages; a small number are brought by companies that have sold\nproducts and could seek injunctive relief as well. These cases have progressed\nto various stages and a small number may have gone to trial or may go to trial\nin the coming 12 months if they are not otherwise resolved.\n\n106\n\n* * *\n\nTable of Contents\n\n  \n\nIn connection with the execution of agreements for the sales of businesses and\ninvestments, Verizon ordinarily provides representations and warranties to the\npurchasers pertaining to a variety of nonfinancial matters, such as ownership\nof the securities being sold, as well as indemnity from certain financial\nlosses. From time to time, counterparties may make claims under these\nprovisions, and Verizon will seek to defend against those claims and resolve\nthem in the ordinary course of business.\n\n  \n\nAs of December 31, 2024, letters of credit totaling approximately $816\nmillion, which were executed in the normal course of business and support\nseveral financing arrangements and payment obligations to third parties, were\noutstanding.\n\n  \n\nAs of December 31, 2024, Verizon had 28 renewable energy purchase agreements\n(REPAs) with third parties. Each of the REPAs is based on the expected\noperation of a renewable energy-generating facility and has a fixed price term\nof 12 to 20 years from the commencement of the facility's entry into\ncommercial operation. Nineteen of the facilities have entered into commercial\noperation, and the remainder are under development. The REPAs generally are\nexpected to be financially settled based on the prevailing market price as\nenergy is generated by the facilities.", "We have various unconditional purchase obligations, which represent agreements\nto purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding. We\nestimate that these unconditional purchase obligations, for contracts with\nterms in excess of one year, total $16.7 billion, and primarily represent\ncommitments to purchase content, network equipment, software and services,\nmarketing services and other items which will be used or sold in the ordinary\ncourse of business from a variety of suppliers. Of this total amount, $6.2\nbillion is attributable to 2025, $5.5 billion is attributable to 2026, $3.1\nbillion is attributable to 2027, $1.3 billion is attributable to 2028, $291\nmillion is attributable to 2029 and $363 million is attributable to years\nthereafter. These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in\nthe future, but represent only those items that are the subject of contractual\nobligations. Our commitments are generally determined based on the\nnoncancelable quantities to which we are contractually obliged. Since the\ncommitments to purchase programming services from television networks and\nbroadcast stations have no minimum volume requirement, we estimated our\nobligation based on number of subscribers at December 31, 2024, and applicable\nrates stipulated in the contracts in effect at that time. We also purchase\nproducts and services as needed with no firm commitment.\n\n  \n\n| |   \n---|---|---"]}, {"fileurl": "https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000732712/000073271225000006/vz-20241231.htm", "section_id": "9", "section_name": null, "section_description": null, "section_content_chunks": ["Item 9.

The new ERP system is designed to enhance the\nflow of financial information, facilitate data analysis and accelerate\ninformation reporting. The implementation is ongoing and is expected to\ncontinue over the next few years.\n\n  \n\nAs the phased implementation of the new ERP system continues, we could have\nchanges to our processes and procedures which, in turn, could result in\nchanges to our internal controls over financial reporting. As such changes\noccur, we will evaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect our\ninternal control over financial reporting.\n\n  \n\nThere were no changes in Verizon's internal control over financial reporting\nduring the fourth quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial\nreporting.\n\n  \n\n107\n\n* * *\n\nTable of Contents\n\n| |   \n---|---|---  \nManagement's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting  \n  \nThe management of Verizon Communications Inc. is responsible for establishing\nand maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting of Verizon.\nManagement has evaluated internal control over financial reporting of Verizon\nusing the criteria for effective internal control established in Internal\nControl-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.\n\n  \n\nManagement has assessed the effectiveness of Verizon's internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2024.
