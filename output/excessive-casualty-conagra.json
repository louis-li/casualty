BUSINESS\n\nGeneral Development of Business\n\nConagra Brands, Inc. (the \"Company\", \"Conagra Brands\", \"we\", \"us\", or \"our\"),\nheadquartered in Chicago, is one of North America's leading branded food\ncompanies. We combine a 100-year history of making quality food with agility\nand a relentless focus on collaboration and innovation. The company's\nportfolio is continuously evolving to satisfy consumers' ever-changing food\npreferences. Conagra's brands include _Birds Eye_ \u00ae, _Duncan Hines_ \u00ae,\n_Healthy Choice_ \u00ae, _Marie Callender 's_\u00ae, _Reddi-wip_ \u00ae, _Slim Jim_ \u00ae, _Angie\n's_\u00ae BOOMCHICKAPOP\u00ae, and many more.\n\nWe began as a Midwestern flour-milling company and entered other commodity-\nbased businesses throughout our history. We were initially incorporated as a\nNebraska corporation in 1919 and reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in\n1976. Over time, we transformed into the branded, pure-play consumer packaged\ngoods food company we are today. Growing our food businesses has also been\nfueled by innovation, organic growth of our brands, and expansion into\nadjacent categories, including through acquisitions. We are focused on\ndelivering sustainable, profitable growth with strong and improving returns on\nour invested capital.\n\nNarrative Description of Business\n\nWe compete throughout the food industry and focus on adding value for our\ncustomers who operate in the retail food and foodservice channels.\n\nOur operations, including our reporting segments, are described below. Our\nlocations, including manufacturing facilities, within each reporting segment,\nare described in Item 2, _Properties_.\n\nReporting Segments\n\nOur reporting segments are as follows:\n\nGrocery & Snacks\n\nThe Grocery & Snacks reporting segment principally includes branded, shelf-\nstable food products sold in various retail channels in the United States.\n\nRefrigerated & Frozen\n\nThe Refrigerated & Frozen reporting segment principally includes branded,\ntemperature-controlled food products sold in various retail channels in the\nUnited States.\n\nInternational\n\nThe International reporting segment principally includes branded food\nproducts, in various temperature states, sold in various retail and\nfoodservice channels outside of the United States.\n\nFoodservice\n\nThe Foodservice reporting segment includes branded and customized food\nproducts, including meals, entrees, sauces, and a variety of custom-\nmanufactured culinary products packaged for sale to restaurants and other\nfoodservice establishments primarily in the United States.\n\n1\n\nUnconsolidated Equity Investments\n\nWe have two unconsolidated equity investments. Our most significant equity\nmethod investment is our joint venture with respect to Ardent Mills, a milling\nbusiness.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe following discussion pertains to all of our reporting segments.\n\nConagra Brands is a branded consumer packaged goods food company that operates\nin many sectors of the food industry, with a significant focus on the sale of\nbranded, value-added consumer food products, as well as foodservice items and\ningredients.\n\n_Raw Materials and Packaging_", "_Raw Materials and Packaging_\n\nWe use many different raw materials, most of which are commodities, to make\nand package our products. The prices paid for raw materials used in making our\nfood generally reflect factors such as global economic conditions, trade\nbarriers or restrictions, supply and demand, weather, commodity market\nfluctuations, currency fluctuations, tariffs, and the effects of governmental\nagricultural programs, and may be impacted by supply chain disruptions\nincluding disruptions caused by pandemics, epidemics, and disease, in humans\nand animals, such as the avian flu. Although the prices of raw materials can\nbe expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors, we believe such raw\nmaterials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous\nsources. From time to time, we have faced increased costs for many of our\nsignificant raw materials, packaging, and energy inputs. We seek to mitigate\nhigher input costs through productivity and pricing initiatives and the use of\nderivative instruments to economically hedge a portion of forecasted future\nconsumption.\n\n_Competition_\n\nWe experience intense competition for sales of our food items in our major\nmarkets. Our food items compete with widely advertised, well-known, branded\nfood, as well as private branded and customized food items. Some of our\ncompetitors are larger and have greater resources than we have. We compete\nprimarily on the basis of quality, product innovation, value, customer\nservice, brand recognition, and brand loyalty.\n\n_Seasonality_\n\nDemand for certain of our food items may be influenced by holidays, changes in\nseasons, or other annual events. For example, sales of frozen foods tend to be\nmarginally higher during the winter months, pie sales are highest in November\nand December due to holidays, and production of certain of our products occurs\nseasonally, during or immediately following the purchase of agricultural\ncrops.\n\n_Trademarks and Intellectual Property_\n\nOur intellectual property rights, including our trademarks, licensing\nagreements, trade secrets, patents, and copyrights are of material importance\nto our business, and we attempt to protect such rights by pursuing remedies\navailable to us under trademark, copyright, trade secret, and patent laws, as\nwell as entering into licensing, third-party nondisclosure and assignment\nagreements, and policing of third-party misuses of our intellectual property.\nSome of our products are sold under licensing arrangements with others,\nincluding our licensing arrangement with Dolly Parton and our licenses of the\n_P.F. Chang_ '_s_ \u00ae, _Bertolli_ \u00ae, _Wendy 's_\u00ae, and _Libby_ '_s_ \u00ae trademarks.\nWe also own certain intellectual property rights that are licensed to third\nparties, such as the _Alexia_ \u00ae and _Marie Callender 's_\u00ae __ trademarks. While\nmany of these licensing arrangements are perpetual in nature, others must be\nperiodically renegotiated or renewed pursuant to their terms. We also actively\ndevelop and maintain a portfolio of patents, although no single patent is\nconsidered material to the business as a whole. We have proprietary trade\nsecrets, technology, know-how, processes, and other intellectual property\nrights that are not registered.\n\n_Government Regulation_\n\nThe manufacture and sale of consumer food is highly regulated. Our operations,\nour products, and our practices are subject to various federal, state, local,\nand international laws and regulations and related regulatory oversight by\nvarious government agencies, including, but not limited to, the United States\nDepartment of Agriculture, the Federal Food and Drug Administration, the\nFederal Trade Commission, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental\n\n2", "2\n\nProtection Agency, the Department of Labor, and various other federal, state,\nlocal, and international authorities (including government authorities in\nCanada and Mexico). In particular, the processing, packaging, transportation,\nstorage, distribution, advertising, labeling, quality, and safety of food\nproducts, the health and safety of our employees, and the protection of the\nenvironment are each subject to governmental regulation. Additionally, we are\nsubject to data privacy and security regulations, anticorruption, anti-\nbribery, trade sanction and export, tax, and securities laws and regulations,\naccounting and reporting standards, and other financial laws and regulations.\nWe rely on our procedures, policies, and compliance programs, as well as legal\nadvice from in-house and outside counsel, to align our operations, products,\nand practices with applicable laws and regulations. We believe that we are in\ncompliance with such laws and regulations in all material respects and do not\nexpect that continued compliance with such regulations will have a material\neffect upon capital expenditures, earnings, or our competitive position.\n\n_Customers_\n\nOur products are sold, directly and through distributors, to chain, wholesale,\nvalue, cooperative, club, and independent grocery, pharmacy and drug,\nconvenience and other store operators; and foodservice customers, including\nrestaurants and bars, travel and leisure customers, schools, health care\nfacilities, and government customers. Our products are also sold online\nthrough various e-commerce platforms and retailers. Our largest customer,\nWalmart, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 28% of\nconsolidated net sales for fiscal 2024 and 2023 and 27% for fiscal 2022.\n\nHuman Capital Resources\n\nAt Conagra, we believe that our employees are the driving force behind our\nsuccess and that the success and growth of our business depends in large part\non our ability to attract, develop, and retain a diverse population of\ntalented and high-performing employees at all levels of our organization. We\nleverage our six timeless values, which form the framework of our Company\nculture, to guide our approach to human capital management:\n\n| \u25cf| Integrity: Do the right things and do things right  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf| External Focus: Center on the consumer, customer, competitor, and\ninvestor  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf| Broad-Mindedness: Seek out and respect varied perspectives; embrace\ncollaboration and assume positive intent  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf| Agility: Convert insights into action with the speed of an entrepreneur  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf| Leadership: Simplify, make decisions, inspire others, and act like an\nowner  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf| Results: Leverage a \"refuse-to-lose\" obsession with impact and value\ncreation  \n---|---|---  \n  \nAs of May 26, 2024, we had approximately 18,500 employees, primarily in the\nUnited States. Approximately 46% of our employees are parties to collective\nbargaining agreements. We believe our relationships with employees and their\nrepresentative organizations are good.\n\n_Safety and Health_", "_Safety and Health_\n\nThe health and safety of our employees is our top priority. We are focused on\nmaintaining a strong culture of safety, in which all employees strive to\nprotect themselves and their colleagues by being proactive towards risk\nidentification and mitigation for people and our food products. Our health and\nsafety team audits each of our facilities every 2-5 years, depending on risk\nprofile, to review compliance with Conagra's safety management system. This\naudit includes examination of leadership, accountability, defect loss\nidentification processes, inspections, training, safety regulation adherence\nand compliance with corporate policies. The team documents the audit results\nand tracks corrective actions to ensure progress and create accountability for\nproviding a safe work environment. Any workplace injury, illness, or fatality\n(an \"incident\"), including any \"significant near miss\" or an incident with the\npotential to have resulted in workplace injury, illness or fatality, requires\na thorough investigation to identify and address the root cause.\n\nDuring fiscal 2024, our Occupational Safety and Health Administration Incident\nRate was 1.40 incidents per 100 full-time workers, as compared to 1.58\nincidents per 100 full-time workers in fiscal 2023 and 1.67 incidents per 100\nfull-time workers in fiscal 2022. There were no incidents of fatalities\ninvolving Conagra employees in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022. We compare our\nincident rate to that of the average for companies in the food manufacturing\nsector, as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In each of the last\nthree fiscal years, our incident rate has been below the industry average.\n\n3\n\n_Human Capital Management_\n\nWe have implemented key recruitment, development, engagement, and retention\nstrategies and objectives to guide our human capital management approach.\nThese strategies and objectives are advanced through a number of programs,\npolicies, and initiatives.\n\nRecruitment:\n\nWe believe Conagra offers one of the most impactful, energized and inclusive\ncultures in the food industry and provides a comprehensive employee experience\nfor a long and prosperous career.\n\nConagra has made differential investments in our recruitment tools and our\ntalent acquisition programs to help us continue to attract the right\ncandidates.\n\n| \u25cf| We have implemented new technology that enhances our recruiting efforts\nwhile also simplifying the application process for prospective candidates.  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf| We modernized our marketing materials to capture and communicate the\nemployee value proposition Conagra offers.  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf| We added resources and enhanced our processes to improve and streamline\nrecruiting efforts at our manufacturing facilities.  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf| We continue to leverage data and key metrics to drive priorities and\nstrategically focus recruiting efforts and talent acquisition resources across\nthe enterprise.  \n---|---|---  \n  \nDevelopment:\n\nThe Conagra Promise to our employees is to provide every employee with tools\nand programs to help them reach their full potential. By providing employees\nwith growth opportunities, we empower them to build knowledge and skills and\nmake an impact through their work at Conagra. We believe that by enabling\nemployee growth and development, we better position Conagra to meet current\nand future business needs while driving employee retention.\n\nWe leverage a variety of tools and processes to promote a culture of employee\nlearning and development at Conagra:", "We leverage a variety of tools and processes to promote a culture of employee\nlearning and development at Conagra:\n\n| \u25cf| Job profiles are aligned to a Conagra-specific skills framework that\ndefines and prioritizes the top skills desired for each role. Employees'\nskills are assessed against the framework and the data is leveraged to provide\ntailored learning opportunities for each employee as well as drive programs to\nenhance organizational capabilities.  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf| Employees have access to numerous development opportunities including\nfunctional development programs, on-demand learning content, and targeted\nleadership programs. Our cross-functional Opportunity Marketplace allows\nemployees to become involved in initiatives beyond their day-to-day job\nresponsibilities, providing on-the-job learning and opportunities for\nexploring their intellectual curiosity.  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf| We use multiple levers to promote a learning culture such as expecting\nleaders to consistently coach, teach and mentor colleagues across the\norganization and our \"Invest in You\" program that encourages employees to set\naside at least one-hour per workweek focused on learning.  \n---|---|---  \n  \nEmployees also have access to coaching, feedback, and leadership support;\nemployees are encouraged to establish mentoring relationships across the\nenterprise.\n\nEngagement, Diversity & Inclusion:\n\nWe believe our focus on broad-mindedness, one of our timeless values, fosters\na culture of collaboration and engagement. We encourage our employees to\nengage with leaders, managers, and peers and to share their individual\nperspectives. In September 2023, we launched a new structured survey, released\non a quarterly basis, to better understand employee engagement and how\nemployees experience our culture.\n\n4\n\nAdditionally, we believe that it is a competitive advantage to cultivate an\ninclusive culture of belonging where diverse backgrounds, perspectives,\nstyles, and opinions are leveraged to drive innovation and growth. At Conagra,\ndiversity is measured by more than age, race, gender, sexual orientation, and\ndisability. All backgrounds, perspectives, styles, and opinions are valued and\nbelong at Conagra. Our recipe for inclusion consists of five key ingredients:\n\n| \u25cf| GENUINE LISTENING: We make a conscious effort to learn new things by\nlistening to what others have to say and seeking to understand how others\nthink and feel. Although we may not always agree, we respect each other and\nacknowledge the power of different points of view.  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf| MUTUAL RESPECT: We cultivate a workplace where people trust and respect\none another, where no one feels they need to bend out of shape to fit in. We\nalways assume positive intent and recognize that individuals have valuable\ncontributions to make.  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf| HEALTHY DEBATE: We actively encourage new ideas and ask questions to\nchallenge the status quo. We accept that sometimes, the best results evolve\nfrom rigorous debate, a bit of tension and a bit of discomfort.  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf| COMPROMISE: We stay focused on our goals and are collectively decisive\nonce the input has been heard and considered.  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf| CIVILITY: We disagree with respect. We seek common ground as a starting\npoint for dialogue about differences, listening past one's preconceptions and\nteaching others to do the same.  \n---|---|---  \n  \nWe believe this recipe nourishes our inclusive culture by encouraging\nopenness, acceptance, and individual authenticity.", "Our eight employee-led Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) are intended to\ncontribute to an engaged and inclusive culture at Conagra. Our ERGs provide\nour employees with an opportunity to express their views, facilitate learning\non cultural and business topics, and support our employees' personal growth,\nprofessional development, and community impact.

You should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply\nthat the risk has not already materialized.\n\nMarket Risks\n\nDeterioration of general economic conditions, an economic recession, periods\nof inflation, or economic uncertainty have in the past harmed and could\ncontinue to harm our business and results of operations.\n\nOur business and results of operations have in the past been and may continue\nto be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions,\nincluding inflation, rising interest rates, decreased availability of capital,\nvolatility in financial markets, declining consumer spending rates,\nrecessions, decreased energy availability and increased energy costs\n(including fuel surcharges), supply chain challenges, labor shortages, the\neffects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions,\ngeopolitical conflicts (including as discussed in the next risk factor), and\nthe negative impacts caused by pandemics, epidemics, and disease, in humans\nand animals, such as the avian flu.\n\nThese economic factors could continue to impact our business and operations in\na variety of ways, including as follows:\n\n| \u25cf| consumers shifting purchases to more generic, lower-priced, or other\nvalue offerings, or foregoing certain purchases altogether during economic\ndownturns, which could result in a reduction in sales of higher margin\nproducts, or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings adversely\naffecting the results of our operations;  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf| decreased demand in the restaurant business, particularly casual and fine\ndining, may adversely affect our Foodservice operations;  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf| volatility in commodity and other input costs could substantially impact\nour result of operations;  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf| volatility in the equity markets or interest rates could substantially\nimpact our pension costs and required pension contributions;  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf| rising interest rates may adversely impact our results of operations; and  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf| it may become more costly or difficult to obtain debt or equity financing\nto fund operations or investment opportunities, or to refinance our debt in\nthe future, in each case on terms and within a time period acceptable to us.  \n---|---|---  \n  \nOur business, financial condition and results of operations have in the past\nbeen and could continue to be adversely affected by disruptions in the global\neconomy caused by geopolitical conflicts.", "Our business, financial condition and results of operations have been impacted\nin the past and may be impacted in the future by disruptions in the global\neconomy. The global economy has been negatively impacted by geopolitical\nconflicts, such as the continuing military conflicts between Russia and\nUkraine, which has resulted in governments in the U.S., United Kingdom, and\nEuropean Union imposing export controls on certain products and financial and\neconomic sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia, the\nconflict between Israel and Hamas, and rising tensions elsewhere in the Middle\nEast and between China and Taiwan. Although we have no direct operations in\nRussia, Ukraine, Israel, elsewhere in the Middle East, China, or Taiwan, we\nhave experienced, or may experience, shortages in materials from these\nregions, increased costs for transportation, energy, and raw materials from\nand in these regions, and reduced consumer confidence and consumption in these\nregions due in part to the negative impact of these conflicts and tensions on\nthe global economy. Further escalations of geopolitical tensions related to\nmilitary conflicts, including increased trade barriers or restrictions on\nglobal trade, could also result in, among other things, cyberattacks, supply\ndisruptions, lower consumer demand, and changes to foreign exchange rates and\nfinancial markets, any of which may adversely affect our business and supply\nchain. In addition, the effects of the ongoing conflicts could heighten many\nof our known risks described in this Item 1A, _Risk Factors_.\n\nCredit Risks\n\nOur existing and future debt may limit cash flow available to invest in the\nongoing needs of our business and could prevent us from fulfilling our debt\nobligations, financing at attractive borrowing costs, or returning cash to\nstockholders.\n\nAs of May 26, 2024, we had total debt of approximately $8.44 billion,\nincluding approximately $7.02 billion aggregate principal amount of\noutstanding senior notes. Our ability to make payments on our debt, fund our\nother liquidity needs, make planned capital\n\n8\n\nexpenditures, and return cash to stockholders will depend on our ability to\ngenerate cash in the future. Our historical financial results have been, and\nwe anticipate that our future financial results will be, subject to\nfluctuations. Our ability to generate cash, to a certain extent, is subject to\ngeneral economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other\nfactors that are beyond our control. We cannot guarantee that our business\nwill generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future\nborrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to\nmake payments of our debt, fund other liquidity needs, make planned capital\nexpenditures, or return cash to stockholders.\n\nOur level of debt could have important consequences. For example, it could:", "Our level of debt could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\n| \u25cf| make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt service obligations;  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf| require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from\noperations to the payment of debt service, reducing the availability of our\ncash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions,\nfavorable business opportunities, and other general corporate purposes;  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf| restrict us from repurchasing shares of our common stock;  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf| negatively impact our ability to pay a cash dividend at an attractive\nlevel;  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf| limit flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in the businesses and\nindustries in which we operate, which may adversely affect our operating\nresults and ability to meet our debt service obligations;  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf| limit our ability to refinance our indebtedness or increase the cost of\nsuch indebtedness;  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf| increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions,\nincluding changes in interest rates;  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf| limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future to fund\nour working capital requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions,\ninvestment, debt service obligations, and other general operating requirements\nor to enable us to react to changes in our business; or  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf| place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses in our\nindustry that have less debt.  \n---|---|---  \n  \nAdditionally, any failure to meet required payments on our debt, or failure to\ncomply with any covenants in the instruments governing our debt, could result\nin an event of default under the terms of those instruments and a downgrade to\nour credit ratings. In the event of a default, the holders of our debt could\nelect to declare all the amounts outstanding under such instruments to be due\nand payable. Any default under the agreements governing our debt and the\nremedies sought by the holders of such debt could render us unable to pay\nprincipal and interest on our debt.\n\nA downgrade to our credit ratings would increase our borrowing costs and could\naffect our ability to issue debt and access the commercial paper markets,\nwhich we actively utilized in fiscal 2024 for our ongoing funding\nrequirements. Additionally, disruptions in the commercial paper market or\nother effects of volatile economic conditions on the credit markets could also\nreduce the amount of commercial paper that we could issue and raise our\nborrowing costs.\n\nWe rely on cash from our subsidiaries to meet our cash flow needs and service\nour debt.", "We rely on cash from our subsidiaries to meet our cash flow needs and service\nour debt.\n\nA significant portion of our operations are conducted through our\nsubsidiaries. As a result, our ability to generate sufficient cash flow for\nour needs is dependent to some extent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and\nthe payment of those earnings to us in the form of dividends, loans, or\nadvances and through repayment of loans or advances from us. Our subsidiaries\nare separate and distinct legal entities. Our subsidiaries have no obligation\nto pay any amounts due on our debt to provide us with funds to meet our cash\nflow needs, whether in the form of dividends, distributions, loans, or other\npayments. In addition, any payment of dividends, loans, or advances by our\nsubsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions.\nPayments to us by our subsidiaries will also be contingent upon our\nsubsidiaries' earnings and business considerations. Our right to receive any\nassets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization\nwill be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary's creditors,\nincluding trade creditors. In addition, even if we are a creditor of any of\nour subsidiaries, our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any\nsecurity interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of\nour subsidiaries senior to that held by us. Finally, changes in the laws of\nforeign jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely affect the ability of\nsome of our foreign subsidiaries to repatriate funds to us.\n\n9\n\nInflation, increased interest rates and other economic conditions including\npotential recession and credit market disruptions could negatively impact our\nbusiness.\n\nCustomer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by heightened\ninflation, increased interest rates and other weak economic conditions\nincluding recessionary conditions and credit market disruptions and\nvolatility. Continued weak economic conditions may adversely impact consumers\ncausing a decrease in demand for our products from our customers and\nconsumers. Additionally, these economic conditions may adversely impact some\nof our customers, suppliers and other vendors who are highly leveraged\nincreasing the risk of uncollectible accounts or trade receivables, extended\npayment terms, and bankruptcy. We have experienced and may continue to\nexperience negative impacts to our business ranging from an inability to\ncollect accounts receivable to supply chain disruptions caused by failures of\nour counterparties to continue as a going concern due to financial and\nliquidity issues.\n\nCompetition Risks\n\nIncreased competition may result in reduced sales or profits.\n\nThe food industry is highly competitive. Retail customer consolidation,\nproliferation of new, competitive products, consumer behavior shifts including\nretail channel preferences, and consumer price sensitivity continue to\ncontribute to increased competition. Our principal competitors have\nsubstantial financial, marketing, and other resources. Increased competition\ncan reduce our sales due to loss of market share or the need to reduce prices\nto respond to competitive and customer pressures. Competitive pressures also\nmay restrict our ability to increase prices and maintain those price\nincreases, including price increases made in response to commodity and other\ncost increases. In addition, we may experience delays between the time that we\ntake inflation-related pricing actions and the time that we realize the impact\nof those actions on our margins and results of operations. Furthermore, our\ninflation-related pricing actions in response to increased costs of goods sold\nmay negatively impact demand for our products, our market share, and our sales\nvolumes.", "We sell branded, private brand, and customized food products, as well as\ncommercially branded foods. Our branded products have an advantage over\nprivate brand products primarily due to advertising and name recognition,\nalthough private brand products typically sell at a discount to those of\nbranded competitors. In addition, when branded competitors focus on price and\npromotion, the environment for private brand producers becomes more\nchallenging because the price difference between private brand products and\nbranded products may become less significant.\n\nIn most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised\nbranded products, but also with other private label and store brand products\nthat are generally sold at lower prices. A strong competitive response from\none or more of our competitors to our marketplace efforts, or a consumer shift\ntowards more generic, lower-priced, or other value offerings, could result in\nus reducing pricing, increasing marketing or other expenditures, or losing\nmarket share. Our margins and profits could decrease if a reduction in prices\nor increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume.\n\nIn fiscal 2024, we made targeted investments in advertising and promotions in\nresponse to market conditions. While our activities generally resulted in\nincreased sales volumes in fiscal 2024 for the targeted products, there is no\nguarantee that our advertising and promotional activities will be successful\nor that our competitors will not engage in more aggressive advertising and\npromotion activities which could negatively impact our sales volumes.\n\nIn addition, substantial growth in e-commerce has encouraged the entry of new\ncompetitors and business models, intensifying competition by simplifying\ndistribution and lowering barriers to entry. The expanding presence of\ne-commerce retailers has impacted, and may continue to impact, consumer\npreferences and market dynamics, which in turn may negatively affect our sales\nor profits.\n\nIf we do not achieve the appropriate cost structure in the highly competitive\nfood industry, our profitability could decrease.\n\nOur future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to\nachieve the appropriate cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly\ncompetitive food industry, particularly in an environment of volatile input\ncosts. We continue to implement profit-enhancing initiatives that impact our\nsupply chain and general and administrative functions. These initiatives are\nfocused on cost-saving opportunities in procurement, manufacturing, logistics,\nand customer service, as well as general and administrative overhead levels.\nGaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time. Our\nfailure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant\ncosts resulting from acquisitions could adversely affect our profitability and\nweaken our competitive position. If we do not continue to effectively manage\ncosts and achieve additional efficiencies, our competitiveness and our\nprofitability could decrease. Additionally, our profitability and ability to\nachieve the appropriate cost structure depends on our ability to fully utilize\nour manufacturing capacity. If we do not maximize our manufacturing capacity,\nour profitability could be negatively impacted.\n\n10\n\nCommodity Risks\n\nWe are subject to increases in the price of raw materials, labor,\nmanufacturing, distribution, and other inputs necessary for the production and\ndistribution of our products, and we may not be able to fully offset this\ninput cost inflation on a timely basis or at all.", "Many of the components of our cost of goods sold are subject to price\nincreases that are attributable to factors beyond our control, including but\nnot limited to, global economic conditions, trade barriers or restrictions,\nsupply chain disruptions, changes in crop size, product scarcity, demand\ndynamics, currency rates, water supply, weather conditions, import and export\nrequirements, and other factors. The cost of raw materials, labor,\nmanufacturing, energy, fuel, packaging materials, transportation and\nlogistics, and other inputs related to the production and distribution of our\nproducts have increased and may continue to increase unexpectedly.\n\nIn recent years, input costs have increased materially and at a rapid rate.\nWhile we expect moderate input cost inflation in fiscal 2025, we could\nexperience unexpectedly high input cost inflation in specific commodities or\nacross multiple commodities.\n\nThe Company uses a variety of strategies to seek to offset this input cost\ninflation such as increasing productivity, cutting costs, increasing pricing\nand engaging in commodity hedging. However, we may not be able to generate\nsufficient productivity improvements or sustain our price increases. Commodity\nprice volatility may result in unfavorable commodity positions, the costs of\nwhich we may not be able to fully offset on acceptable timelines or at all. To\nthe extent we are unable to offset present and future input cost increases,\nour operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nIncreases in commodity costs have in the past and may continue to have a\nnegative impact on profits.\n\nWe use many different commodities such as wheat, corn, oats, various\nvegetables, vegetable oils, beef, pork, poultry, dairy products, steel,\naluminum, and energy. Commodities are subject to price volatility caused by\nglobal economic conditions, trade barriers or restrictions, supply chain\ndisruptions, commodity market fluctuations, supply and demand, currency\nfluctuations, external conditions such as weather, and changes in governmental\nagricultural and energy policies and regulations. In addition, recent world\nevents have increased the risks posed by international trade disputes,\ntariffs, and sanctions. We procure a wide spectrum of commodities globally and\nin the past have faced increased prices for commodities sourced from nations\nthat have been impacted by trade disputes, tariffs, or sanctions. Commodity\nprice increases have resulted and may in the future result in increases in raw\nmaterial, packaging, and energy costs and operating costs. We have experience\nin hedging against commodity price increases; however, these practices and\nexperience reduce, but do not eliminate, the risk of negative profit impacts\nfrom commodity price increases. We do not fully hedge against changes in\ncommodity prices, and the risk management procedures that we use may not\nalways work as we intend.\n\nTo mitigate commodity cost increases, we have implemented various strategies\nthat include, among other things, entering into contracted pricing with\ncertain vendors, procuring commodities in periods of favorable market\nconditions, or entering into various derivative instruments. These actions may\nin part mitigate these increased costs, but even by increasing our product\nprices or implementing cost savings efforts, we may not be able to fully\noffset these increased costs. Additionally, increased prices may not be\nsustainable over time and may result in reduced sales volume, which can\nnegatively impact our margins, and profitability.\n\nVolatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to\nfluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our gross margins\nand net earnings.", "Volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to\nfluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our gross margins\nand net earnings.\n\nWe utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal\ningredients and energy costs, including grains (wheat and corn), vegetable\noils, pork, dairy products, and energy. Changes in the values of these\nderivatives are generally recorded in earnings currently, resulting in\nvolatility in both gross margin and net earnings. These gains and losses are\nreported in cost of goods sold in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and\nin unallocated general corporate expenses in our segment operating results\nuntil we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process, at which\ntime the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit. We may\nexperience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments.\n\nOperating Risks\n\nSupply chain disruptions have in the past and could continue to negatively\nimpact our profitability.\n\nIn recent years, our industry has been impacted by supply chain disruptions,\ntransportation issues, labor challenges and continued changes in global\neconomic conditions, which have impacted and could continue to impact our\noperations and profitability. Continued inflation, rising interest rates,\ndecreased availability of capital, volatility in financial markets, declining\nconsumer spending rates, recessions, decreased energy availability and\nincreased energy costs (including fuel surcharges) have in the past caused and\ncould\n\n11\n\ncontinue to cause challenges for us, our suppliers, vendors, customers and\nconsumers of our products and may negatively impact our profitability. These\nsupply chain disruptions have impacted our ability to source ingredients and\nmanufacture and distribute our products, and may make it difficult for our\ncustomers to accurately forecast and plan for their purchases of our products\nto optimize restocking, all of which could negatively impact our business and\nprofitability.\n\nWe have in the past been and may in the future be subject to product recalls,\nproduct liability and labeling claims, and changing legal or regulatory\nrequirements, any of which could negatively impact our profitability.\n\nWe sell food products for human consumption, which involves risks such as\nproduct contamination or spoilage, product tampering, other adulteration of\nfood products such as foreign material, mislabeling, and misbranding. We may\nbe subject to liability if the consumption of any of our products causes\ninjury, illness, or death. In addition, we may take marketplace action such as\na voluntary product recall in the event of contamination or damage. We have\nissued recalls and have from time to time been and currently are involved in\nlawsuits relating to our food products. A significant product liability\njudgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact our sales and\nprofitability for a period of time depending on the costs of the recall, the\ndestruction of product inventory, product availability, competitive reaction,\ncustomer reaction, and consumer attitudes.", "In addition, we could be the target of claims of false or deceptive\nadvertising under U.S. federal and state laws as well as foreign laws,\nincluding consumer protection statutes of some states. The marketing of food\nproducts has come under increased regulatory scrutiny in recent years, and the\nfood industry has been subject to an increasing number of proceedings and\nclaims relating to alleged false or deceptive labeling and marketing under\nfederal, state and foreign laws or regulations. Changes in legal or regulatory\nrequirements (such as new food safety requirements, new food labeling\nrequirements for allergens and nutrition information, updated requirements for\nthe use of \"healthy\" in connection with our food products, and bans on certain\nfood ingredients or packaging materials), evolving interpretations of existing\nlegal or regulatory requirements, or changes in enforcement priorities may\nresult in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, higher production\ncosts, and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our\nbusiness or financial results. If we are found to be out of compliance with\napplicable laws and regulations in these areas, we could be subject to civil\nremedies, including fines, injunctions, termination of necessary licenses or\npermits, or recalls, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nEven if a product liability or labeling claim is unsuccessful or is not fully\npursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products\ncaused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing\nand potential customers and our corporate and brand image.\n\nAdditionally, as a manufacturer and marketer of food products, we are subject\nto extensive regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S.\nDepartment of Agriculture, and other federal, state, and local government\nagencies. The Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act (including as amended by the\nFood Safety Modernization Act), the Federal Meat, Poultry Products, and Egg\nProducts Inspection Acts, and their respective regulations govern, among other\nthings, the manufacturing, composition and ingredients, packaging, labeling,\nand safety of food products. Some aspects of these laws use a strict liability\nstandard for imposing sanctions on corporate behavior; meaning that no intent\nis required to be established. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and\nregulations, we may be subject to civil remedies, including fines,\ninjunctions, recalls, or seizures, as well as criminal sanctions, any of which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or\nresults of operations.\n\nAny damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nMaintaining a good reputation is critical to selling our products. Product\ncontamination or tampering, the failure to maintain high standards for product\nquality, safety, and integrity, including with respect to raw materials and\ningredients obtained from suppliers, or allegations of product quality issues,\nmislabeling, or contamination, even if untrue, may reduce demand for our\nproducts or cause production and delivery disruptions. Our reputation could\nalso be adversely impacted by any of the following, or by adverse publicity\n(whether or not valid) relating thereto: product recalls, the failure to\nmaintain high ethical, social, and environmental standards for all of our\noperations and activities including our expectations for our supply chain\nregarding ethical sourcing; the failure to achieve any stated goals with\nrespect to the nutritional profile of our products; our research and\ndevelopment efforts; or our environmental impact, including use of\nagricultural materials, packaging, energy use, and waste management.", "Moreover, the growing use of social and digital media by consumers has greatly\nincreased the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions\ncan be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands, or our\nproducts on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and\nreputation. Additionally, negative reaction to our marketing and advertising,\nincluding our social media content, could result in damage to our brands and\nreputation.\n\n12\n\nFailure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective\nsystem of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial\ninformation could also hurt our reputation. Damage to our reputation or loss\nof consumer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could\nresult in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, as\nwell as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.\n\nDue to the seasonality of the business, our revenue and operating results may\nvary from quarter to quarter.\n\nOur sales and cash flows are affected by seasonal cyclicality. For example,\nsales of frozen foods, including frozen vegetables and frozen complete bagged\nmeals, tend to be marginally higher during the winter months and pie sales\npeak during the months of November and December due to holidays. Since many of\nthe raw materials we process are agricultural crops, production of these\nproducts is predominantly seasonal, occurring during and immediately following\nthe purchase of such crops. For these reasons, sequential quarterly\ncomparisons are not a good indication of our performance or how we may perform\nin the future. If we are unable to obtain access to working capital or if\nseasonal fluctuations are greater than anticipated, there could be a material\nadverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash\nflows.\n\nConsumer and Customer Risks\n\nWe must identify changing consumer preferences and develop and offer food\nproducts and packaging to meet their preferences.\n\nConsumer preferences evolve over time and the success of our food products\ndepends on our ability to identify the priorities, tastes and dietary habits\nof consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences. Consumer\nresponse to our products may be influenced by a growing number and complexity\nof factors influencing consumer purchasing decisions beyond taste, nutrition\nand value, including concerns of consumers regarding broader health and\nwellness perceptions, obesity, product attributes, sourcing of packaging\nmaterials, use of organic or natural ingredients, human rights impacts,\nenvironmental impacts, recyclability of packaging and local sourcing of\ningredients. Growing use of weight loss medication may cause shifts in\nconsumer preferences and, if we fail to anticipate and appropriately respond\nto customer preferences, may impact our product sales, financial condition,\nand operating results.\n\nIntroduction of new products and product extensions requires significant\ndevelopment and marketing investment. If our products fail to meet changing\nconsumer preferences or habits, or if we fail to introduce new and improved\nproducts on a timely basis, then the return on that investment will be less\nthan anticipated and our strategy to grow sales and profits with investments\nin acquisitions, marketing, and innovation will be less successful. Similarly,\ndemand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns or perceptions\nregarding the health effects of certain packaging materials (such as per- and\npolyfluoroalkyl substances commonly referred to as PFAS), ingredients such as\ncolors or preservatives, sodium, trans fats, sugar, genetically modified\ningredients, or other product attributes.\n\nChanges in our relationships with significant customers, including our largest\ncustomer, could adversely affect us.", "Changes in our relationships with significant customers, including our largest\ncustomer, could adversely affect us.\n\nDuring fiscal 2024, our largest customer, Walmart, Inc. and its affiliates,\naccounted for approximately 28% of our consolidated net sales. There can be no\nassurance that Walmart, Inc. and other significant customers will continue to\npurchase our products in the same quantities or on the same terms as in the\npast, particularly as increasingly powerful retailers continue to demand lower\npricing. The loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales\nto a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product\nsales, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nOur customers are generally not contractually obligated to purchase from us\nand their decision to purchase from us is driven by multiple factors including\nconsumer preferences and demand, price, product quality, customer service\nperformance, availability, and other factors. Strategic and financial goals of\nour customers can impact their purchasing decisions including store space\nallocation among product categories and shelf placement of our products.\n\nThe sophistication and buying power of our customers could have a negative\nimpact on profits.\n\nOur customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs, and food distributors,\nhave continued to consolidate, resulting in fewer customers on which we can\nrely for business. These consolidations, the growth of supercenters, and the\ngrowth of e-commerce customers have produced large, sophisticated customers\nwith increased buying power and negotiating strength who are more capable of\nresisting price increases and who can demand lower pricing, increased\npromotional programs, or specialty tailored products. In addition, larger\nretailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate\nwith reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer brands.\nThese customers may also in the future use more of their shelf space,\ncurrently used for our products, for their store\n\n13\n\nbrand products. We continue to implement initiatives to counteract these\npressures. However, if the larger size of these customers results in\nadditional negotiating strength and/or increased private label or store brand\ncompetition, our profitability could decline.\n\nConsolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers'\nbusiness operations or financial performance will have a corresponding\nmaterial adverse effect on us. For example, if our customers cannot access\nsufficient funds or financing, then they may delay, decrease, or cancel\npurchases of our products, or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases.\n\nThird-Party Partner Risks\n\nDisruption of our supply chain has had and could continue to have an adverse\nimpact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.", "Third-Party Partner Risks\n\nDisruption of our supply chain has had and could continue to have an adverse\nimpact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nOur ability to make, move, and sell our products is critical to our success.\nDisruptions to our supply chain, including disruptions to our third-party\nmanufacturing or transportation and distribution capabilities, due to labor\nshortages, increased labor costs, weather, including any potential effects of\nclimate change, natural disaster, fire or explosion, terrorism, strikes,\ngovernment action, geopolitical turmoil, pandemics, or other reasons beyond\nour control or the control of our suppliers and business partners, could\nimpair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. Failure to take\nadequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events,\nor to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a\nproduct is sourced from a single supplier or location, could adversely affect\nour business or financial results. In addition, disputes with significant\nsuppliers, including disputes regarding pricing or performance, could\nadversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could\nmaterially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\n\nAlthough our products are manufactured in North America and we source the\nsignificant majority of our ingredients and raw materials from North America,\nglobal supply has at times been and may continue to be constrained, which has\ncaused and may continue to cause the price of certain ingredients and raw\nmaterials used in our products to increase and/or we may experience\ndisruptions to our operations. Additionally, although we have no direct\noperations in Russia, Ukraine, Israel, elsewhere in the Middle East, China, or\nTaiwan, we have experienced, or may experience, shortages in materials from\nthese regions, increased costs for transportation, energy, and raw materials\nfrom and in these regions, and reduced consumer confidence and consumption in\nthese regions due in part to the negative impact of military conflicts and\nrising tensions in these areas on the global economy. To date, these conflicts\nhave not had a material impact on our business, financial condition, or\nresults of operations, but continued geopolitical turmoil may negatively\nimpact our supply chain and our ability to manufacture or sell our products.\n\nThe termination or expiration of current co-manufacturing arrangements could\nreduce our sales volume and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nOur businesses periodically enter into co-manufacturing arrangements with\nmanufacturers of products. The terms of these agreements vary. Although many\nagreements are for a relatively short period of time, some of the co-\nmanufacturing agreements are for extended periods. Volumes produced under each\nof these agreements can fluctuate significantly based upon the product's life\ncycle, product promotions, alternative production capacity, and other factors,\nnone of which are under our direct control. Our future ability to enter into\nco-manufacturing arrangements is not guaranteed, and an inability for the\nCompany to obtain favorable co-manufacturing pricing or a decrease in co-\nmanufacturing availability or production capacity could have a significant\nnegative impact on sales volume.\n\nAs we outsource certain functions, we become more dependent on the third\nparties performing those functions.", "As we outsource certain functions, we become more dependent on the third\nparties performing those functions.\n\nAs part of a concerted effort to achieve cost savings and efficiencies, we\nhave entered into agreements with third-party service providers under which we\nhave outsourced certain information systems, sales, finance, accounting, and\nother functions, and we may enter into managed services agreements with\nrespect to other functions in the future. If any of these third-party service\nproviders do not perform according to the terms of the agreements, or if we\nfail to adequately monitor their performance, we may not be able to achieve\nthe expected cost savings or we may have to incur additional costs to correct\nerrors made by such service providers, and our reputation could be harmed.\nDepending on the function involved, such errors may also lead to business\ninterruption, damage or disruption of information technology systems,\nprocessing inefficiencies, the loss of or damage to intellectual property or\nnon-public company sensitive information, effects on financial reporting,\nlitigation or remediation costs, or damage to our reputation, any of which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nIn addition, if we transition functions to one or more new, or among existing,\nexternal service providers, we may experience challenges such as delays,\nerrors, additional costs, service interruptions, and disruptions to our\noperations that could have a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations or financial condition.\n\n14\n\nOur operations are dependent on a wide array of third parties.\n\nThe success of our end-to-end supply chain relies on the continued performance\nof a wide array of third parties. Suppliers, co-manufacturers, third-party\noutsourcers, warehousing partners, and transportation providers are among our\ncritical partners. Although we take steps to qualify and audit third parties\nwith whom we do business, we cannot guarantee that all third parties will\nperform dependably or at all. It is possible that events beyond our control,\nsuch as operational failures, financial failure, labor issues, cybersecurity\nevents, pandemics, epidemics, and disease, in humans and animals, or other\nissues could impact our unaffiliated third parties. If our third parties fail\nto deliver on their commitments, introduce unplanned risk to our operations,\nor are unable to fulfill their obligations, we could experience manufacturing\nchallenges, shipment delays, increased costs, or lost revenue.\n\nWe may be negatively impacted by cybersecurity incidents involving third\nparties in our supply chain.\n\nIf any of our third party service providers or any other third parties in our\nsupply chain experience a cyber breach or system failure, their businesses may\nbe negatively impacted, which can disrupt our end-to-end supply chain or\naffect our ability to fulfill customer orders, both of which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business. For example, in the fourth quarter of\nfiscal 2023, we incurred charges totaling $4.4 million ($3.3 million after-\ntax) related to supply chain disruptions caused by a third-party vendor's\nsystem shutdown in connection with the third party experiencing a\ncybersecurity incident. The vendor's shut-down disrupted our operations and\nnegatively impacted our ability to fulfill customer orders.\n\nLegal, Regulatory, and Environmental Risks\n\nIf we fail to comply with the many laws applicable to our business, we may\nface lawsuits or incur significant fines and penalties. In addition, changes\nin such laws may lead to increased costs.", "If we fail to comply with the many laws applicable to our business, we may\nface lawsuits or incur significant fines and penalties. In addition, changes\nin such laws may lead to increased costs.\n\nOur business is subject to a variety of governmental laws and regulations,\nincluding food and drug laws, environmental laws, laws related to advertising\nand marketing practices, accounting standards, taxation requirements,\ncompetition laws, employment laws, data privacy laws, human rights laws, and\nanti-corruption laws, among others, in and outside of the United States. Our\noperations are subject to various laws and regulations administered by\nfederal, state, local and foreign government agencies, including, but not\nlimited to, the United States Department of Agriculture, the Federal Food and\nDrug Administration, the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Product Safety\nCommission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency, and the Department of Labor. In particular,\nthe processing, packaging, transportation, storage, distribution, advertising,\nlabeling, quality, and safety of food products, the health and safety of our\nemployees, and the protection of the environment are each subject to\ngovernmental regulation. Additionally, we are subject to data privacy and\nsecurity regulations, tax and securities regulations, accounting and reporting\nstandards, and other financial laws and regulations. Our failure to comply\nwith applicable laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits,\nadministrative penalties, and civil remedies, including fines, injunctions,\nand recalls of our products.\n\nWe may suffer losses if changes to regulations require us to change the\ningredients we use or how we process, package, transport, store, distribute,\nadvertise, or label our products or include changes that increase our risk of\nliability for deceptive advertising. Moreover, depending on the implementation\nof such regulatory changes, we could have increased risk for a product recall\nor have existing inventory become unsellable, which could materially and\nadversely impact our product sales, financial condition and operating results.\n\nIn addition, changes in applicable laws and regulations, including changes in\ntaxation requirements and new or increased tariffs on products imported from\ncertain countries, may lead to increased costs and could negatively affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nOur operations are also subject to extensive and increasingly stringent\nregulations administered by the Environmental Protection Agency and similar\nstate, local, and foreign government agencies, which pertain to the discharge\nof materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes.\nFailure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences,\nincluding civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity. Changes\nin applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof,\nincluding increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other\ngreenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change, may\nresult in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, and other\nfinancial obligations for us, which could affect our profitability or impede\nthe production or distribution of our products, and affect our net operating\nrevenues.\n\n15\n\nClimate change, or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate\nchange, may negatively affect our business and operations.", "15\n\nClimate change, or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate\nchange, may negatively affect our business and operations.\n\nThere is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the\natmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather\npatterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural\ndisasters. In the event that such climate change has a negative effect on\nagricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less\nfavorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products,\nsuch as wheat, tomatoes, and a wide array of vegetables. Adverse weather\nconditions and natural disasters can reduce crop size and crop quality, which\nin turn could reduce our supplies of raw materials, lower recoveries of usable\nraw materials, increase the prices of our raw materials, increase our cost of\ntransporting and storing raw materials, or disrupt our production schedules.\n\nWe may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing\nfor water as a result of such change, which could impact our manufacturing and\ndistribution operations. In addition, natural disasters and extreme weather\nconditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of\nour supply chain. The increasing concern over climate change also may result\nin more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements\nincluding changes to energy policies, increased mandatory disclosure, carbon\npricing regulations or carbon taxes. In the event that such additional\nregulations are enacted and are more aggressive than the climate risk\nmitigation measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions\nand improve our energy efficiency, we may experience significant increases in\nour costs of operation and delivery. In particular, increasing regulation of\nfuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain\ncosts associated with our products. As a result, climate change could\nnegatively affect our business and operations.\n\nWhile we continue to take important steps to strive toward mitigation of\nclimate risk and impact on climate change, transitioning our business to adapt\nto and comply with evolving policy, legal, and regulatory changes may impose\nsubstantial operational and compliance burdens. As a result, climate change\ncould negatively affect our business and operations. Collecting, measuring and\nanalyzing information relating to such matters can be costly, time-consuming,\ndependent on third-party cooperation and unreliable. Furthermore,\nmethodologies for measuring, tracking and reporting on such matters continue\nto change over time, which requires our processes and controls for such data\nto evolve as well. Additionally, we may face increased pressure from\ncustomers, consumers, investors, activists and other stakeholders to modify\nour products or operations away from ingredients or activities that are\nconsidered to have a higher impact on climate change. Such changes to\nmethodologies or lack of progress (whether actual or perceived) could\nadversely affect our business, operations, and reputation, and increase risk\nof litigation.", "From time to time, we establish strategies and expectations related to climate\nchange and other environmental matters. Our ability to achieve any such\nstrategies or expectations is subject to numerous factors and conditions, many\nof which are outside of our control. Examples of such factors include, but are\nnot limited to, evolving regulatory and other standards, processes, and\nassumptions, the pace of scientific and technological developments, increased\ncosts and the availability of requisite financing, market trends that may\nalter business opportunities, the conduct of third-party manufacturers and\nsuppliers, constraint or disruptions to our supply chain, and changes in\ncarbon markets or carbon taxes. We may be required to expend significant\nresources to achieve these strategies and expectations, which could\nsignificantly increase our operational costs. There can be no assurance of the\nextent to which any of our strategies or expectations will be achieved, or\nthat any future investments we make in furtherance of achieving these\nstrategies or expectations will meet customer or investor expectations.\nFailures or delays (whether actual or perceived) in achieving our strategies\nor expectations related to climate change and other environmental matters\ncould adversely affect our business, operations, and reputation, and increase\nrisk of litigation.\n\nCybersecurity and Information Technology Risks\n\nOur business operations could be disrupted if our information technology\nsystems fail to perform adequately.\n\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the\nInternet, to process, transmit, and store information, to manage and support a\nvariety of business processes and activities, and to comply with regulatory,\nlegal, and tax requirements. Our information technology systems, some of which\nare dependent on services provided by third parties, may be vulnerable to\ndamage, interruption, or shutdown due to any number of causes outside of our\ncontrol such as catastrophic events, natural disasters, fires, power outages,\nsystems failures, telecommunications failures, employee error or malfeasance,\nsecurity breaches, computer viruses or other malicious codes, ransomware,\nunauthorized access attempts, denial of service attacks, phishing, social\nengineering, hacking, and other cyberattacks. Additionally, the increase in\nhybrid working where employees, including third-party employees, access\ntechnology infrastructure remotely may create additional information\ntechnology and data security risks.\n\n16\n\nIf we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build\nand sustain the proper technology infrastructure and associated automated and\nmanual control processes, we could be subject to billing, payment, and\ncollection errors, business disruptions, or damage resulting from security\nbreaches. If any of our significant information technology systems suffer\nsevere damage, disruption, or shutdown, and our business continuity plans do\nnot effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our product sales,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely\naffected, and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results.\nIn addition, there is a risk of business interruption, violation of data\nprivacy laws and regulations, litigation, and reputational damage from leakage\nof confidential information. Any interruption of our information technology\nsystems could have operational, reputational, legal, and financial impacts\nthat may have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nWe are exposed to cybersecurity risk through our information systems and our\nuse of third-party information systems.", "We are exposed to cybersecurity risk through our information systems and our\nuse of third-party information systems.\n\nWhile we have experienced threats to our data and systems, to date, we are not\naware that we have experienced a breach that had a material impact on our\noperations or business. Cyberattacks are occurring more frequently, are\nconstantly evolving in nature and are becoming more sophisticated.\nAdditionally, continued geopolitical turmoil, including the Russia-Ukraine\nmilitary conflict, has heightened the risk of cyberattacks. While we attempt\nto continuously monitor and mitigate against cyber risks, including through\nleveraging multi-sourced threat intelligence, investing in new technologies,\nand developing third-party cybersecurity risk management capability in support\nof strategic suppliers, we may incur significant costs in protecting against\nor remediating cyberattacks or other cyber incidents.\n\nSophisticated cybersecurity threats pose a potential risk to the security and\nviability of our information technology systems, as well as the\nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data stored on those\nsystems, including cloud-based platforms. In addition, new technology that\ncould result in greater operational efficiency may further expose our computer\nsystems to the risk of cyberattacks. Our initiatives to continue to modernize\nour operations, increase data digitalization and improve connectively of our\nproduction facilities may increase our potential exposure to cybersecurity\nrisks and add additional complexity to our cybersecurity program. Similarly,\nrapid development and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technology\nmay create the need for rapid modifications to our cybersecurity program and\nincrease our cybersecurity risks. Additionally, the technology and techniques\nused in cyberattacks are constantly evolving and the pace and extent of that\nevolution may accelerate with the use of emerging technologies including\nartificial intelligence.\n\nWhile we maintain a cyber insurance policy that provides coverage for security\nincidents, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for\nliabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to\nus on financially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not\ndeny coverage as to any future claim. Increased cyber incidents, both in terms\nof frequency and scale, may impact the availability and cost of cyber\ninsurance globally which may negatively impact our ability to maintain\nsufficient coverage. There is no assurance that the measures we have taken to\nprotect our information technology systems will prevent or limit the impact of\na future cyber incident.\n\nWe are subject to a variety of privacy and data protection laws and\nregulations.\n\nAdditionally, we regularly move data across national borders to conduct our\noperations and, consequently, are subject to a variety of laws and regulations\nin the United States and other jurisdictions regarding privacy, data\nprotection, and data security, including those related to the collection,\nstorage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data,\nincluding the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, the\nCalifornia Privacy Rights Act, and similar laws in other countries, states and\njurisdictions. Our efforts to comply with privacy and data protection laws may\nimpose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time.\n\nEmployee Risks\n\nWe rely on our management team and other key personnel.", "Employee Risks\n\nWe rely on our management team and other key personnel.\n\nWe depend on the skills, working relationships, and continued services of key\npersonnel, including our experienced management team. In addition, our ability\nto achieve our operating goals depends on our ability to identify, attract,\nhire, train, retain, and develop qualified individuals in the locations we\nneed. If key employees terminate their employment, our business activities may\nbe adversely affected by shortages of personnel with the skills, knowledge and\ntalent that we need to effectively run and grow our business. Our business\nactivities may also be adversely affected if we are unable to locate suitable\nreplacements for any key employees who leave or to offer employment to\npotential replacements on reasonable terms.\n\nWe offer robust training and development programs to help our employees\ndevelop the skills they need. Increased employee turnover results in\nsignificant time and expense relating to identifying, recruiting, hiring,\nrelocating and integrating qualified individuals. High employee turnover of\nkey personnel may deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our\ncompetitiveness.\n\n17\n\nWe compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for\ntalented personnel. We continue to experience increased competition for talent\nand at times, in recent years, have experienced periods of increased employee\nturnover. We could experience shortages of employees with specialized skills,\nsuch as skills in emerging technologies including artificial intelligence and\ndata analytics, especially emerging technology enabling us to formulate our\nbusiness strategies based on consumer insights. If we do not successfully\ncompete for the best talent, our business activities may be adversely\naffected.\n\nA number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us at\nour multiple locations or increase labor costs, including high employment\nlevels, population migration, unemployment programs and subsidies, immigration\nlaws, and other government regulations, and volatility in general\nmacroeconomic factors impacting the labor market. Although we have not\nexperienced any material labor shortage to date, over the past few years, we\nhave experienced a tighter and increasingly competitive labor market. A\nsustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base\n(or within the employee base of key suppliers or third-party manufacturers),\ncould negatively affect our supply chain or our ability to efficiently operate\nour manufacturing and distribution facilities and overall business.\n\nOur results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased pension,\nlabor, and people-related expenses.\n\nOur labor costs include wages and the cost of providing employee benefits\nincluding pension, health and welfare, and severance benefits. The annual cost\nof providing these benefits varies as a result of factors such as the\navailability of skilled labor, the costs of health care, and the outcome of\ncollectively bargained wage and benefit agreements. In addition, changes in\ninterest rates, mortality rates, health care costs, early retirement rates,\ninvestment returns, and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded\nstatus of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the future funding\nrequirements of the plans. A significant increase in our wage and benefit\ncosts, pension obligations, or future funding requirements could have a\nnegative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations.\n\nGoodwill or Other Intangible Assets Risks\n\nImpairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangibles could result\nin the incurrence of impairment charges and negatively impact our net worth.", "Goodwill or Other Intangible Assets Risks\n\nImpairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangibles could result\nin the incurrence of impairment charges and negatively impact our net worth.\n\nAs of May 26, 2024, we had goodwill of $10.58 billion and other intangibles of\n$2.71 billion. The net carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of\nacquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the\nacquisition date (or subsequent impairment date, if applicable). The net\ncarrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks,\ncustomer relationships, and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition\ndate (or subsequent impairment date, if applicable), net of accumulated\namortization. Goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute\nindefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized, but must be evaluated by\nmanagement at least annually for impairment. Amortized intangible assets are\nevaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate\nthat the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable. Impairments\nto goodwill and other intangible assets may be caused by multiple factors\nincluding increasing competitive pressures, reduced demand for our products,\ndisruption in our operations as a result of internal and external events\nincluding disruptions involving co-manufacturing arrangements, lower than\nexpected revenue and profit growth rates, changes in industry earnings before\ninterest, taxes, depreciation and amortization multiples, changes in discount\nrates based on changes in cost of capital (interest rates, etc.), or the\nbankruptcy of a significant customer. Any impairment to goodwill or other\nintangible assets could negatively impact our net worth.\n\n18\n\nSecurities Risks\n\nWe may not repurchase the full share repurchase value currently authorized.\n\nThe Company's total remaining share repurchase authorization as of May 26,\n2024 was $916.6 million of our outstanding common stock. This authorization\ndoes not obligate us to repurchase any shares at any time. The amount and\ntiming of any stock repurchases will be determined based on multiple factors\nincluding stock price, liquidity, economic and market conditions. We cannot\nguarantee that we will continue share repurchases up to the authorized amount,\nand furthermore, if we do repurchase any of our stock, such action may not\nresult in increased value for our stockholders.\n\nStrategic Transactions Risks\n\nIf we are unable to successfully identify, complete or realize the benefits\nfrom strategic acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures or investment, our\nfinancial results could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nFrom time to time, we evaluate acquisition candidates that may strategically\nfit our business objectives. If we are unable to complete acquisitions or\nsuccessfully integrate and develop acquired businesses, our financial results\ncould be materially and adversely affected.\n\nSimilarly, we may consider divesting businesses that do not meet our strategic\nobjectives or do not meet our growth or profitability targets. We may not be\nable to complete desired divestitures on terms favorable to us. If we do\ncomplete such desired divestitures, gains or losses on the sales of, or lost\noperating income from, those businesses may affect our profitability and\nmargins.\n\nMoreover, in connection with contemplated or completed acquisitions or\ndivestitures, we may incur related asset impairment charges that reduce our\nprofitability.\n\nOur acquisition, joint venture and investment activities may present\nfinancial, managerial, and operational risks.", "Our acquisition, joint venture and investment activities may present\nfinancial, managerial, and operational risks.\n\nOur acquisition, joint venture and investment activities may present certain\nrisks, including diversion of management attention from existing businesses,\ndifficulties integrating personnel and financial and other systems, effective\nand immediate implementation of control environment processes across our\nemployee population, adverse effects on existing business relationships with\nsuppliers and customers, inaccurate estimates of fair value made in the\naccounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets\nwhich would reduce future reported earnings, potential loss of customers or\nkey employees, and indemnities and potential disputes with sellers, joint\nventure partners and investment targets. Any of these factors could affect our\nsales, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nSimilarly, our divestiture activities may present financial, managerial, and\noperational risks such as diversion of management attention from existing\nbusinesses. Additionally, divestitures may present difficulties separating\npersonnel and financial and other systems, possible need for providing\ntransition services to buyers, adverse effects on existing business\nrelationships with suppliers and customers and indemnities and potential\ndisputes with the buyers and others. Any of these factors could adversely\naffect our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nIntellectual Property Risks\n\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect\nthem could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\n\nOur intellectual property rights, including our trademarks, licensing\nagreements, trade secrets, patents, and copyrights, are a significant and\nvaluable aspect of our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual\nproperty rights by pursuing remedies available to us under trademark,\ncopyright, trade secret, and patent laws, as well as entering into licensing,\nthird-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of third-\nparty misuses of our intellectual property. If we fail to adequately protect\nthe intellectual property rights we have now or may acquire in the future, or\nif there occurs any change in law or otherwise that serves to reduce or remove\nthe current legal protections of our intellectual property, then our financial\nresults could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nCertain of our products are sold under licensing arrangement with others,\nincluding our licensing arrangement with Dolly Parton, and our licenses of the\n_P.F. Chang_ '_s_ \u00ae, _Bertolli_ \u00ae, _Wendy 's_\u00ae, and _Libby_ '_s_ \u00ae trademarks.\nAdditionally, we have licensed certain of our intellectual property rights to\nthird parties, such as _Alexia_ \u00ae and _Marie Callender 's_\u00ae. While many of\nthese licensing arrangements\n\n19\n\nare perpetual in nature, others must be periodically renegotiated or renewed\npursuant to their terms. If in the future we are unable to renew such a\nlicensing arrangement pursuant to its terms and conditions, or if we fail to\nrenegotiate such a licensing arrangement, then our financial results could be\nmaterially and adversely affected.\n\nThere is also a risk that other parties may have intellectual property rights\ncovering some of our brands, products, or technology. If any third parties\nbring a claim of intellectual property infringement against us, we may be\nsubject to costly and time-consuming litigation, diverting the attention of\nmanagement and our employees. If we are unsuccessful in defending against such\nclaims, we may be subject to, among other things, significant damages,\ninjunctions against development and sale of certain products, or we may be\nrequired to enter into costly licensing agreements, any of which could have an\nadverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations."]}, {"fileurl": "https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000023217/000155837024009764/tmb-20240526x10k.htm", "section_id": "1B", "section_name": null, "section_description": null, "section_content_chunks": ["ITEM 1B.

(the \"Company\", \"Conagra Brands\", \"we\", \"us\", or \"our\"),\nheadquartered in Chicago, is one of North America's leading branded food\ncompanies. We combine a 100-year history of making quality food with agility\nand a relentless focus on collaboration and innovation. The company's\nportfolio is continuously evolving to satisfy consumers' ever-changing food\npreferences. Conagra's brands include _Birds Eye_ \u00ae, _Duncan Hines_ \u00ae,\n_Healthy Choice_ \u00ae, _Marie Callender 's_\u00ae, _Reddi-wip_ \u00ae, _Slim Jim_ \u00ae, _Angie\n's_\u00ae BOOMCHICKAPOP\u00ae, and many more.\n\nFiscal 2024 Results\n\nFiscal 2024 performance compared to fiscal 2023 reflected a decrease in net\nsales, with organic (excludes the impacts of foreign exchange) decreases in\nour Grocery & Snacks and Refrigerated & Frozen segments, partially offset by\nincreases in our International and Foodservice segments. The overall decrease\nin net sales was primarily due to lower consumption trends, consumer behavior\nshifts, and strategic trade investment as consumers continue to adapt to the\ncurrent environment of new reference prices. Overall gross profit increased\nprimarily as a result of higher productivity, lower transportation costs, and\nlower inventory write-offs, which were partially offset by input cost\ninflation, lower net sales, and unfavorable operating leverage. Excluding\nitems impacting comparability, overall segment operating profit increased in\nour Grocery & Snacks, International, and Foodservice segments, which was more\nthan offset by a decrease in our Refrigerated & Frozen segment. Corporate\nexpenses were lower primarily due to lower share-based payment expense and\nitems impacting comparability, as discussed below. Selling, general and\nadministrative (\"SG&A\") expenses were higher due primarily to items impacting\ncomparability and higher payroll and incentive compensation expense. We\nrecognized lower equity method investment earnings, higher interest expense,\nand higher income tax expense, in each case compared to fiscal 2023. Excluding\nitems impacting comparability, our effective tax rate was slightly lower\ncompared to fiscal 2023.\n\nDiluted earnings per share were $0.72 and $1.42 in fiscal 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. Diluted earnings per share were affected by lower net income as\nwell as several significant items affecting the comparability of year-over-\nyear results (see _\" Items Impacting Comparability\"_ below).\n\nTrends Impacting our Business\n\nOur industry continues to be impacted by commodity cost fluctuations, labor\ncost inflation, input cost inflation, supply chain disruptions, and other\nglobal macroeconomic challenges. While in recent years we experienced material\nincreases to input costs and supply chain disruptions, during fiscal 2024, we\nexperienced a moderate amount of input cost inflation and increased supply\nchain stability, which we expect to continue throughout fiscal 2025.", "We also have experienced a reduction to our volumes due to lower consumption\ntrends seen throughout the industry and consumer behavior shifts, including\nretail channel preferences. We expect consumer trends to continue to evolve\nand our volumes to improve over time, however, economic pressures on\nconsumers, including the challenges of high inflation, may continue to\nnegatively impact our volumes throughout fiscal 2025. We will continue to\nevaluate the evolving macroeconomic environment to take action to mitigate the\nimpact on our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial\ncondition.\n\nItems Impacting Comparability\n\nItems of note impacting comparability of results for fiscal 2024 included the\nfollowing:\n\n| \u25cf| charges totaling $956.7 million ($847.7 million after-tax) related to the\nimpairments of goodwill and certain brand intangible assets,  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf| charges totaling $66.6 million ($49.9 million after-tax) in connection\nwith our restructuring plans,  \n---|---|---  \n  \n25\n\n| \u25cf| charges totaling $36.4 million ($36.0 million after-tax) related to the\nimpairment of a business held for sale,  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf| net charges totaling $34.8 million ($26.2 million after-tax) related to\nlegacy legal matters,  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf| a benefit of $11.5 million ($8.7 million after-tax) related primarily to\nour year-end remeasurement of an hourly pension plan liability, and  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf| a net gain of $8.7 million ($6.6 million after-tax) primarily associated\nwith insurance proceeds from the previous fire that occurred at one of our\nmanufacturing facilities.  \n---|---|---  \n  \nItems of note impacting comparability of results for fiscal 2023 included the\nfollowing:\n\n| \u25cf| charges totaling $730.9 million ($592.2 million after-tax and net of\nnoncontrolling interest) related to the impairments of goodwill and certain\nbrand intangible assets,  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf| an income tax benefit of $28.1 million associated with concluding that\ncertain tax elections made by a subsidiary had a confidence level of more-\nlikely-than-not, which allowed us to release a valuation allowance,  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf| charges totaling $26.7 million ($20.1 million after-tax) related to the\nimpairment of businesses previously held for sale,  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf| charges of $13.4 million ($10.1 million after-tax) associated with fires\noccurring at one of our manufacturing facilities,  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf| charges totaling $13.1 million ($9.9 million after-tax) in connection\nwith our restructuring plans,  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf| charges of $8.4 million ($6.7 million after-tax) related to transaction\ncosts associated with a planned divestiture that was not ultimately\nconsummated,  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf| charges totaling $4.4 million ($3.3 million after-tax) related to a\nthird-party vendor's cybersecurity incident, and  \n---|---|---  \n| \u25cf| charges totaling $3.8 million ($2.8 million after-tax) related to a\nlegacy legal matter.  \n---|---|---  \n  \nSegment presentation of gains and losses from derivatives used for economic\nhedging of anticipated commodity input costs and economic hedging of foreign\ncurrency exchange rate risks of anticipated transactions are discussed in the\nsegment review below.\n\nSEGMENT REVIEW\n\nWe reflect our results of operations in four reporting segments: Grocery &\nSnacks, Refrigerated & Frozen, International, and Foodservice.\n\nGrocery & Snacks\n\nThe Grocery & Snacks reporting segment principally includes branded, shelf-\nstable food products sold in various retail channels in the United States.\n\nRefrigerated & Frozen\n\nThe Refrigerated & Frozen reporting segment principally includes branded,\ntemperature-controlled food products sold in various retail channels in the\nUnited States.\n\nInternational\n\nThe International reporting segment principally includes branded food\nproducts, in various temperature states, sold in various retail and\nfoodservice channels outside of the United States.\n\n26\n\nFoodservice", "26\n\nFoodservice\n\nThe Foodservice reporting segment includes branded and customized food\nproducts, including meals, entrees, sauces, and a variety of custom-\nmanufactured culinary products that are packaged for sale to restaurants and\nother foodservice establishments primarily in the United States.\n\nPresentation of Derivative Gains (Losses) from Economic Hedges of Forecasted\nCash Flows in Segment Results\n\nDerivatives used to manage commodity price risk and foreign currency risk are\nnot designated for hedge accounting treatment. We believe these derivatives\nprovide economic hedges of certain forecasted transactions. As such, these\nderivatives are generally recognized at fair market value with realized and\nunrealized gains and losses recognized in general corporate expenses. The\ngains and losses are subsequently recognized in the operating results of the\nreporting segments in the period in which the underlying transaction being\neconomically hedged is included in earnings. In the event that management\ndetermines a particular derivative entered into as an economic hedge of a\nforecasted commodity purchase has ceased to function as an economic hedge, we\ncease recognizing further gains and losses on such derivatives in corporate\nexpense and begin recognizing such gains and losses within segment operating\nresults, immediately. See Note 17, _\" Derivative Financial Instruments\"_, to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report for further\ndiscussion.\n\nPresentation of Information\n\nBelow is a detailed discussion and comparison of our results of operations for\nthe fiscal years ended May 26, 2024 and May 28, 2023.

Price/mix increased by 2.6% compared to fiscal 2023\nprimarily due to favorable brand mix and favorability in inflation-driven\npricing, partially offset by an increase in strategic trade investments. In\nfiscal 2023, we had a product recall primarily related to our _Armour Star_ \u00ae\nbrand, which resulted in a $7.8 million reduction to net sales for customer\nreturns and fees in addition to estimated lost sales of approximately $40\nmillion.\n\nNet sales for fiscal 2024 in our Refrigerated & Frozen segment included a\ndecrease in volumes of 4.1% compared to fiscal 2023 primarily due to lower\nconsumption trends seen throughout the industry partially offset by the\nimpacts of our strategic trade investments. Price/mix decreased by 1.5%\ncompared to fiscal 2023 primarily attributable to an increase in strategic\ntrade investments slightly offset by favorability in inflation-driven pricing\nthat was implemented in the prior year.", "Net sales for fiscal 2024 in our International segment reflected a 2.9%\nincrease due to favorable foreign exchange rates, a 2.6% increase in volumes,\nand a 2.1% increase in price/mix, in each case compared to fiscal 2023. The\nincrease in volumes was driven by growth in our Mexico business compared to\nfiscal 2023. The increase in price/mix was primarily due to favorability in\ninflation-driven pricing that was implemented in the prior year.\n\nNet sales for fiscal 2024 in our Foodservice segment included an increase in\nprice/mix of 6.7% compared to fiscal 2023, reflecting inflation-driven\npricing. Volumes decreased by 5.7% compared to fiscal 2023. The decrease in\nvolumes was driven by the ongoing impact of lost business, ongoing softness in\nrestaurant traffic, and the elasticity impact from inflation-driven pricing\nactions.\n\n27\n\nSG&A Expenses (Includes general corporate expenses)\n\nSG&A expenses totaled $2.48 billion for fiscal 2024, an increase of $291.1\nmillion compared to fiscal 2023.

The higher\ngross profit was due to inflation driven pricing that was primarily\nimplemented in the prior year, productivity, lower transportation costs, lower\ninventory write-offs, and a net benefit of $14.4 million related to insurance\nproceeds received for lost sales from our _Armour Star_ \u00ae brand recall. These\nincreases were partially offset by the impacts of input cost inflation and\nunfavorable fixed cost leverage. The increase in gross profits was partially\noffset by higher SG&A expenses, including an increase of $10.0 million in\nadvertising and promotion expenses. Operating profit of the Grocery & Snacks\nsegment included certain brand intangible impairment charges of $77.6 million\nand $78.9 million in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. Fiscal 2024 and 2023\nincluded charges of $10.3 million and $0.6 million, respectively, related to\nour restructuring plans. Fiscal 2023 included expenses of $3.5 million related\nto a municipal water break that impacted one of our production facilities.\n\nOperating profit in our Refrigerated & Frozen segment for fiscal 2024\nreflected a decrease in gross profits of $95.0 million compared to fiscal\n2023. The decrease was driven by the net sales decline discussed above,\nimpacts of input cost inflation, and unfavorable fixed cost leverage,\npartially offset by productivity, lower transportation costs, and lower\ninventory write-offs. Operating profit of the Refrigerated & Frozen segment\nincluded higher SG&A expenses compared to fiscal 2023, which included a\ndecrease of $19.3 million in advertising and promotion expenses. The segment\nwas impacted by charges of $879.1 million and $252.6 million related to the\nimpairment of goodwill and certain brand intangible assets as part of our\nannual impairment testing during fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. Fiscal\n2023 also included charges of $385.7 million related to the goodwill and\n_Birds Eye_ \u00ae brand impairments in connection with certain reporting unit\nchanges within our Refrigerated & Frozen segment. Fiscal 2024 and 2023\nincluded $32.1 million and $5.1 million, respectively, of charges related to\nour restructuring plans. Fiscal 2024 and 2023 included a net benefit of $2.8\nmillion and net charges of $15.3 million, respectively, associated with fires\noccurring at certain of our manufacturing facilities and related insurance\nrecoveries. Operating profit in fiscal 2023 was also impacted by $4.2 million\nof incremental transportation costs and inventory write-offs as a result of\nsupply chain disruptions caused by a third-party vendor's system shutdown in\nconnection with the third party experiencing a cybersecurity incident and $5.7\nmillion related to the impairment of businesses previously held for sale.", "Operating profit in our International segment for fiscal 2024 reflected an\nincrease in gross profits of $32.9 million compared to fiscal 2023, reflecting\nthe net sales growth discussed above and productivity, partially offset by the\nimpacts of input cost inflation. The increase in gross profits was partially\noffset by higher SG&A expenses, including an increase of $6.3 million in\nadvertising and promotion expenses. Operating profit in fiscal 2024 included\ncharges of $36.4 million related to the impairment of a business held for sale\nand $20.8 million of net charges related to our restructuring plans. Fiscal\n2023 was impacted by charges of $13.7 million related to the impairment of\ncertain brand intangible assets.\n\nOperating profit in our Foodservice segment for fiscal 2024 reflected an\nincrease in gross profits of $46.7 million compared to fiscal 2023. The\nincrease in gross profit was driven by the net sales growth discussed above,\nproductivity, and lower transportation costs, partially offset by the impacts\nof input cost inflation and unfavorable fixed cost leverage. Operating profit\nin fiscal 2024 and 2023 was impacted by net benefits of $5.9 million and $1.9\nmillion, respectively, associated with insurance recoveries related to a fire\nthat occurred at one of our manufacturing facilities. Fiscal 2023 included\nexpense of $20.5 million related to the impairment of businesses previously\nheld for sale.\n\nPension and Postretirement Non-service Income\n\nIn fiscal 2024, pension and postretirement non-service income was $10.3\nmillion, a decrease of $13.9 million compared to fiscal 2023. Fiscal 2024\nreflected higher interest costs, partially offset by a benefit of $11.5\nmillion related primarily to our annual remeasurement of an hourly pension\nplan liability.\n\n29\n\nInterest Expense, Net\n\nIn fiscal 2024, net interest expense was $430.5 million, an increase of $20.9\nmillion, or 5.1%, from fiscal 2023. The increase was driven by a higher\nweighted average interest rate on outstanding debt. See Note 3, _\" Long-Term\nDebt\"_, to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report for\nfurther discussion.\n\nEquity Method Investment Earnings\n\nWe include our share of the earnings of certain affiliates based on our\neconomic ownership interest in the affiliates. Our most significant affiliate\nis the Ardent Mills joint venture. Our share of earnings from our equity\nmethod investment earnings were $177.6 million and $212.0 million for fiscal\n2024 and 2023, respectively. Ardent Mills earnings for fiscal 2024 reflected\nslightly lower volume trends as seen throughout the industry, partially offset\nby improved product margins.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nOur income tax expense was $262.5 million and $218.7 million in fiscal 2024\nand 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate (calculated as the ratio of\nincome tax expense to pre-tax income, inclusive of equity method investment\nearnings) was approximately 43.0% and 24.2% for fiscal 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. The higher effective tax rate was largely due to the goodwill\nimpairment that we recorded in our Sides, Components, Enhancers reporting\nunit. See Note 14, _\" Pre-Tax Income and Income Taxes\"_, to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements contained in this report for a further discussion on the\nchange in effective tax rates.\n\nWe expect our effective tax rate in fiscal 2025, exclusive of any unusual\ntransactions or tax events, to be approximately 23-24%.\n\nEarnings Per Share\n\nDiluted earnings per share in fiscal 2024 and 2023 were $0.72 and $1.42,\nrespectively. The decrease in diluted earnings per share reflected lower net\nincome. See _\" Items Impacting Comparability\"_ above as several significant\nitems affected the comparability of year-over-year results of operations.\n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nSources of Liquidity and Capital", "LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nSources of Liquidity and Capital\n\nThe primary objective of our financing strategy is to maintain a prudent\ncapital structure that provides us flexibility to pursue our growth\nobjectives. We use a combination of equity and short- and long-term debt. We\nuse short-term debt principally to finance ongoing operations, including our\nseasonal requirements for working capital (accounts receivable, prepaid\nexpenses and other current assets, and inventories, less accounts and other\npayables, accrued payroll, and other accrued liabilities). We strive to\nmaintain solid investment grade credit ratings.\n\nManagement believes that existing cash balances, cash flows from operations,\nexisting credit facilities, our commercial paper program, and access to\ncapital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our debt\nobligations, including any repayment of debt or refinancing of debt, working\ncapital needs, planned capital expenditures, other contractual obligations,\nand payment of anticipated quarterly dividends for at least the next twelve\nmonths and the foreseeable future thereafter.\n\nBorrowing Facilities and Long-Term Debt\n\nAt May 26, 2024, we had a revolving credit facility (the \"Revolving Credit\nFacility\") with a syndicate of financial institutions providing for a maximum\naggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of $2.0 billion\n(subject to increase to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $2.5 billion\nwith the consent of the lenders). The Revolving Credit Facility matures on\nAugust 26, 2027 and is unsecured. The Company may request the term of the\nRevolving Credit Facility be extended for additional one-year or two-year\nperiods from the then-applicable maturity date on an annual basis. We have\nhistorically used a credit facility principally as a back-up for our\ncommercial paper program. As of May 26, 2024, there were no outstanding\nborrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.\n\nWe had $586.0 million outstanding under our commercial paper program as of May\n26, 2024 and $576.0 million outstanding as of May 28, 2023. The highest level\nof borrowings during fiscal 2024 was $697.0 million.\n\n30\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we entered into an unsecured Term\nLoan with a financial institution and borrowed the full principal amount,\n$300.0 million, available thereunder (the \"2024 Term Loan\"). The net proceeds,\nalong with the issuance of commercial paper and operating cash flows, were\nused to repay the $1.00 billion aggregate principal amount of our 4.30% senior\nnotes on their maturity date of May 1, 2024. The 2024 Term Loan matures on\nApril 29, 2025.\n\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we prepaid $250.0 million of the\n$500.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under our unsecured Term\nLoan Agreement, dated August 26, 2023 (the \"2023 Term Loan\"). The repayment\nwas funded by operating cash flows and the issuance of commercial paper. The\nremaining balance of the 2023 Term Loan matures on August 26, 2025.\n\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we issued $500.0 million aggregate\nprincipal amount of 5.30% senior notes due October 1, 2026. The net proceeds,\nalong with operating cash flows, were used to repay the outstanding $500.0\nmillion aggregate principal amount of our 0.50% senior notes on their maturity\ndate of August 11, 2023.\n\nAdditional information about our long-term debt balances as of May 26, 2024\ncan be found in Note 3, _\" Long-Term Debt\"_, to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements contained in this report. The weighted-average coupon interest rate\nof the long-term debt obligations outstanding as of May 26, 2024, was\napproximately 4.9%.", "We expect to maintain or have access to sufficient liquidity to retire or\nrefinance long-term debt at maturity or otherwise, from operating cash flows,\nour commercial paper program, access to the capital markets, and our Revolving\nCredit Facility. We continuously evaluate opportunities to refinance our debt;\nhowever, any refinancing is subject to market conditions and other factors,\nincluding financing options that may be available to us from time to time, and\nthere can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully refinance any\ndebt on commercially acceptable terms at all.\n\nAs of the end of fiscal 2024, our senior long-term debt ratings were all\ninvestment grade. A significant downgrade in our credit ratings would not\naffect our ability to borrow amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility,\nalthough borrowing costs would increase. A downgrade of our short-term credit\nratings would impact our ability to borrow under our commercial paper program\nby negatively impacting borrowing costs and causing shorter durations, as well\nas making access to commercial paper more difficult, or impossible.\n\nOur most restrictive debt agreement (the Revolving Credit Facility) generally\nrequires our ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and\namortization (\"EBITDA\") to interest expense not be less than 3.0 to 1.0 and\nour ratio of funded debt to EBITDA not to exceed 4.5 to 1.0. Each ratio is to\nbe calculated on a rolling four-quarter basis. As of May 26, 2024, we were in\ncompliance with all financial covenants.\n\nEquity and Dividends\n\nWe repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time after considering\nmarket conditions and in accordance with repurchase limits authorized by our\nBoard. Under our current share repurchase authorization, we may repurchase our\nshares periodically over several years, depending on market conditions and\nother factors, and may do so in open market purchases or privately negotiated\ntransactions. The share repurchase authorization has no expiration date. We\ndid not repurchase any shares of common stock during fiscal 2024. The\nCompany's total remaining share repurchase authorization as of May 26, 2024\nwas $916.6 million.\n\nOn April 11, 2024, we announced that our Board had authorized a quarterly\ndividend payment of $0.35 per share, which was paid on May 30, 2024, to\nstockholders of record as of the close of business on April 30, 2024.\nSubsequent to our fiscal year end, on July 11, 2024, we announced that our\nBoard had authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share to be paid on\nAugust 29, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on\nAugust 1, 2024.\n\nContractual Obligations\n\nAs part of our ongoing operations, we enter into contractual arrangements that\nobligate us to make future cash payments. These obligations impact our\nliquidity and capital resource needs. In addition to principal and interest\npayments on our outstanding long-term debt and notes payable balances,\ndiscussed above, our contractual obligations primarily consist of lease\npayments, income taxes, pension and postretirement benefits, and unconditional\npurchase obligations.\n\nA summary of our operating and finance lease obligations as of May 26, 2024\ncan be found in Note 15, _\" Leases\"_, to the Consolidated Financial Statements\ncontained in this report.\n\n31\n\nThe liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax\npositions was $21.7 million as of May 26, 2024. See Note 14, _\" Pre-Tax Income\nand Income Taxes\"_, to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this\nreport for information related to income taxes.", "As of May 26, 2024, we had an aggregate funded pension asset of $164.2 million\nand an aggregate unfunded postretirement benefit obligation totaling $44.4\nmillion. We expect to make payments totaling approximately $11.7 million and\n$6.6 million in fiscal 2025 to fund our pension and postretirement plans,\nrespectively. See Note 18, _\" Pension and Postretirement Benefits\"_, to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements and _\" Critical Accounting Estimates -\nEmployee-Related Benefits\"_ contained in this report for further discussion of\nour pension obligation and factors that could affect estimates of these\nobligations.\n\nAs of May 26, 2024, our unconditional purchase obligations (i.e., obligations\nto transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or\nservices at fixed or minimum prices, such as \"take-or-pay\" contracts) totaled\napproximately $2.53 billion. Approximately $1.80 billion of this balance is\ndue in fiscal 2025. Included in this amount are open purchase orders and other\nsupply agreements totaling approximately $1.49 billion, which are generally\nsettleable in the ordinary course of business in less than one year.\nWarehousing service agreements totaling approximately $562 million make up a\nmajority of our remaining unconditional purchase obligations with various\nterms of up to 10 years.\n\nWe expect to have sufficient cash flows from the above cited sources to meet\nthe material cash requirements of these contractual obligations as they become\nsettleable in the ordinary course of business.\n\nCapital Expenditures\n\nWe continue to make investments in our business and operating facilities. Our\npreliminary estimate of capital expenditures for fiscal 2025 is approximately\n$500 million.\n\nCash Flows\n\nIn fiscal 2024, we used $14.9 million of cash, which was the net result of\n$2.02 billion generated from operating activities, $375.0 million used in\ninvesting activities, $1.66 billion used in financing activities, and an\nincrease of $1.2 million due to the effects of changes in foreign currency\nexchange rates.\n\nCash generated from operating activities totaled $2.02 billion in fiscal 2024,\nas compared to $995.4 million generated in fiscal 2023. The increase in\noperating cash flows for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 was primarily\ndriven by a reduction in our inventory balances, which were impacted by lower\nnet sales volumes in addition to an inventory rebuild from previous supply\nchain constraints in fiscal 2023. Other changes in working capital were\npositively impacted by decreased accounts receivables and extended payment\nterms with certain vendors resulting in reduced cash outflows for accounts and\nother payables. Operating cash flows in fiscal 2024 also benefited from higher\ndividend payments received from one of our equity method investments.\n\nCash used in investing activities totaled $375.0 million in fiscal 2024\ncompared to $354.9 million in fiscal 2023. Net cash outflows from investing\nactivities in fiscal 2024 and 2023 consisted primarily of capital expenditures\ntotaling $388.1 million and $362.2 million, respectively.\n\nCash used in financing activities totaled $1.66 billion in fiscal 2024\ncompared to $631.6 million in fiscal 2023. Financing activities in fiscal 2024\nprincipally reflected repayments of long-term debt of $1.77 billion, the\nissuance of long-term debt totaling $500.0 million, net short-term borrowing\nissuances of $290.6 million, and cash dividends paid of $659.3 million.\nFinancing activities in fiscal 2023 reflected repayments of long-term debt of\n$712.4 million, the issuance of long-term debt totaling $500.0 million, net\nshort-term borrowing issuances of $351.4 million, cash dividends paid of\n$623.8 million, and common stock repurchases of $150.0 million.\n\nCash Held by International Subsidiaries", "Cash Held by International Subsidiaries\n\nThe Company had cash and cash equivalents of $77.7 million at May 26, 2024,\nand $93.3 million at May 28, 2023, of which $66.7 million at May 26, 2024, and\n$84.9 million at May 28, 2023, was held in foreign countries. A deferred tax\nliability is provided for certain undistributed foreign earnings that are not\nconsidered to be indefinitely reinvested or cannot be remitted in a tax-\nneutral transaction. Other undistributed foreign earnings are invested\nindefinitely and therefore we have not provided deferred taxes on those\nearnings.\n\n32\n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nThe process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on\nthe part of management. The estimates used by management are based on our\nhistorical experiences combined with management's understanding of current\nfacts and circumstances. Certain of our accounting estimates are considered\ncritical as they are both important to the portrayal of our financial\ncondition and results and require significant or complex judgment on the part\nof management. The following is a summary of certain accounting estimates\nconsidered critical by management.\n\nOur Audit/Finance Committee has reviewed management's development, selection,\nand disclosure of the critical accounting estimates.\n\nMarketing Costs--We offer various forms of trade promotions which are mostly\nrecorded as a reduction in revenue. The methodologies for determining these\nprovisions are dependent on local customer pricing and promotional practices,\nwhich range from contractually fixed percentage price reductions to provisions\nbased on actual occurrence or performance. Our promotional activities are\nconducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and\ninclude activities such as in-store displays and events, feature price\ndiscounts, consumer coupons, and loyalty programs. The costs of these\nactivities are recognized as a reduction of revenue at the time the related\nrevenue is recorded, which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure. The\nrecognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding\nthe volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail\ntrade or consumer. These estimates are made using various techniques including\nhistorical data on performance of similar promotional programs. Differences\nbetween estimated expense and actual redemptions are recognized as a change in\nmanagement estimate in a subsequent period.\n\nWe have recognized trade promotion liabilities of $120.4 million as of May 26,\n2024. Changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual\ncustomer marketing program would not result in a material change in our\nresults of operations or cash flows.", "Income Taxes--Our income tax expense is based on our income, statutory tax\nrates, and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions\nin which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different\ninterpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing\nauthorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our income tax\nexpense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating\nuncertainties. Management reviews tax positions at least quarterly and adjusts\nthe balances as new information becomes available. Deferred income tax assets\nrepresent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income\nin future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between\nthe tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in our\nconsolidated balance sheets, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit\ncarryforwards. Management evaluates the recoverability of these future tax\ndeductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from\nall sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted\noperating earnings, and available tax planning strategies. These estimates of\nfuture taxable income inherently require significant judgment. Management uses\nhistorical experience and short and long-range business forecasts to develop\nsuch estimates. Further, we employ various prudent and feasible tax planning\nstrategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. To the\nextent management does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred\ntax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established.\n\nFurther information on income taxes is provided in Note 14, _\" Pre-tax Income\nand Income Taxes\"_, to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this\nreport.\n\nEmployee-Related Benefits--We incur certain employment-related expenses\nassociated with our pension plans. In order to measure the annual expense\nassociated with these pension benefits, management must make a variety of\nestimates including, but not limited to, discount rates used to measure the\npresent value of certain liabilities, assumed rates of return on assets set\naside to fund these expenses, employee turnover rates, and anticipated\nmortality rates. The estimates used by management are based on our historical\nexperience as well as current facts and circumstances. We use third-party\nspecialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense\nassociated with these pension benefits. Different estimates used by management\ncould result in us recognizing different amounts of expense over different\nperiods of time.\n\nThe Company uses a split discount rate (the \"spot-rate approach\") for the U.S.\nplans and certain foreign plans. The spot-rate approach applies separate\ndiscount rates for each projected benefit payment in the calculation of\npension service and interest cost.\n\nWe have recognized a pension liability of $95.9 million and $101.6 million as\nof the end of fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. We also have recognized a\npension asset of $260.1 million and $249.9 million as of the end of fiscal\n2024 and 2023, respectively, as certain individual plans of the Company had a\npositive funded status.\n\n33\n\nWe recognize cumulative changes in the fair value of pension plan assets and\nnet actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair\nvalue of plan assets or the plan's projected benefit obligation (\"the\ncorridor\") in current period expense annually as of our measurement date,\nwhich is our fiscal year-end, or when measurement is required otherwise under\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.", "We recognized a pension benefit from Company plans of $0.6 million, $13.9\nmillion, and $54.4 million in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Such\namounts reflect the year-end write-off of actuarial losses (gains) in excess\nof 10% of our pension liability of $(12.5) million, $0.1 million, and $(2.9)\nmillion in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. This also reflected\nexpected returns on plan assets of $141.3 million, $145.9 million, and $145.4\nmillion in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. We contributed $12.2\nmillion, $12.5 million, and $11.5 million to our pension plans in fiscal 2024,\n2023, and 2022, respectively. We anticipate contributing approximately $11.7\nmillion to our pension plans in fiscal 2025.\n\nOne significant assumption for pension plan accounting is the discount rate.\nWe use a spot-rate approach, discussed above. This approach focuses on\nmeasuring the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic\nbenefit cost by using individual spot rates derived from a high-quality\ncorporate bond yield curve and matched with separate cash flows for each\nfuture year instead of a single weighted-average discount rate approach.\n\nBased on this information, the weighted-average discount rate selected by us\nfor determination of the interest cost component of our pension expense was\n5.41% for fiscal 2024, 4.09% for fiscal 2023, and 2.29% for fiscal 2022. The\nweighted-average discount rate selected by us for determination of the service\ncost component of our pension expense was 5.60% for fiscal 2024, 4.74% for\nfiscal 2023, and 3.50% for fiscal 2022. We selected a weighted-average\ndiscount rate of 5.72% and 5.51% for determination of service and interest\nexpense, respectively, for fiscal 2025. A 25-basis point increase in our\ndiscount rate assumption as of the end of fiscal 2024 would increase our\nannual pension expense for our pension plans by $2.5 million. A 25-basis point\ndecrease in our discount rate assumption as of the end of fiscal 2024 would\ndecrease our annual pension expense for our pension plans by $2.6 million. For\nour year-end pension obligation determination, we selected discount rates of\n5.58% and 5.50% for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nAnother significant assumption used to account for our pension plans is the\nexpected long-term rate of return on plan assets. In developing the assumed\nlong-term rate of return on plan assets for determining pension expense, we\nconsider long-term historical returns (arithmetic average) of the plan's\ninvestments, the asset allocation among types of investments, estimated long-\nterm returns by investment type from external sources, and the current\neconomic environment. Based on this information, we selected 5.00% for the\nweighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for\ndetermining our fiscal 2024 pension expense. A 25-basis point\nincrease/decrease in our weighted-average expected long-term rate of return\nassumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2024 would decrease/increase annual\npension expense for our pension plans by $7.1 million. A 25-basis point\nincrease/decrease in our expected long-term rate of return assumption as of\nthe beginning of fiscal 2025 would decrease/increase annual pension expense\nfor our pension plans by $6.6 million. We selected a weighted-average expected\nrate of return on plan assets of 5.53% to be used to determine our pension\nexpense for fiscal 2025.", "Business Combinations, Impairment of Long-Lived Assets (including property,\nplant and equipment), Identifiable Intangible Assets, and Goodwill--We use the\nacquisition method in accounting for acquired businesses. Under the\nacquisition method, our financial statements reflect the operations of an\nacquired business starting from the closing of the acquisition. The assets\nacquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective estimated\nfair values at the date of the acquisition. Any excess of the purchase price\nover the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is\nrecorded as goodwill. Significant judgment is often required in estimating the\nfair value of assets acquired, particularly intangible assets. As a result, in\nthe case of significant acquisitions we normally obtain the assistance of a\nthird-party valuation specialist in estimating fair values of tangible and\nintangible assets. The fair value estimates are based on available historical\ninformation and on expectations and assumptions about the future, considering\nthe perspective of marketplace participants. While management believes those\nexpectations and assumptions are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain.\nUnanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur,\nwhich could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.\n\nWe reduce the carrying amounts of long-lived assets to their fair values when\ntheir carrying amount is determined to not be recoverable. We generally\ncompare undiscounted estimated future cash flows of an asset or asset group to\nthe carrying values of the asset or asset group for property, plant and\nequipment. If the undiscounted estimated future cash flows exceed the carrying\nvalues of the asset or asset group, no impairment is recognized. If the\nundiscounted estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying values of\nthe asset or asset group, we write-down the asset or assets to their estimated\nfair values. The estimates of fair value are generally in the form of\nappraisal, or by discounting estimated future cash flows of the asset or asset\ngroup.\n\n34\n\nDetermining the useful lives of intangible assets also requires management\njudgment. Certain brand intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives\nbased on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the\nacquired brands, while other acquired intangible assets (e.g., customer\nrelationships) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our estimates\nof the useful lives of definite-lived intangible assets are primarily based\nupon historical experience, the competitive and macroeconomic environment, and\nour operating plans. The costs of definite-lived intangibles are amortized to\nexpense over their estimated life.", "We reduce the carrying amounts of indefinite-lived intangible assets, and\ngoodwill to their fair values when the fair value of such assets is determined\nto be less than their carrying amounts (i.e., assets are deemed to be\nimpaired). Fair value is estimated using a \"relief from royalty\" methodology\nfor our indefinite-lived intangible assets and is typically estimated using a\ndiscounted cash flow method for our goodwill, which requires us to estimate\nthe future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular reporting\nunit being tested for impairment as well as to select a discount rate to\nmeasure the present value of the anticipated cash flows. In certain\ncircumstances, we also utilize a guideline public company method which is\nbased on market multiples and our estimated EBITDA that considers public\ncompanies that are comparable to our reporting units. When determining future\ncash flow estimates under the guideline public company method or discounted\ncash flow method, we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current\nand anticipated operating conditions. Estimating future cash flows requires\nsignificant judgment by management in such areas as future economic\nconditions, industry-specific conditions, product pricing, and necessary\ncapital expenditures. The use of different assumptions or estimates for\nselected EBITDA multiples and future cash flows could produce different\nimpairment amounts (or none at all) for goodwill and indefinite-lived\nintangible assets. For further information on our indefinite-lived intangible\nassets and goodwill, see Note 1, \"_Summary of Significant Accounting Policies_\n\", to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report.\n\nAs of May 26, 2024, we have goodwill of $10.58 billion, indefinite-lived\nintangibles of $2.03 billion and definite-lived intangibles of $681.6 million.\nHistorically, we have experienced material impairments in brand intangibles\nand goodwill as a result of declining sales, reductions to our assumed royalty\nrates due to lower-than-expected profit margins, and other economic conditions\nsuch as increases to interest rates. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we\nrecorded goodwill impairments of $526.5 million in our Sides, Components,\nEnhancers reporting unit. The carrying value in our Sides, Components,\nEnhancers reporting unit was approximately $3.2 billion as of our fiscal 2024\nannual impairment testing date and was the only reporting unit with 10% or\nless excess fair value over carrying value as of that date. For our Sides,\nComponents, Enhancers reporting unit, we selected a discount rate of 8.50% and\na long-term growth rate that approximated 1%.\n\nIn fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, we recorded total indefinite-lived intangibles\nimpairments of $430.2 million, $589.2 million, and $209.0 million,\nrespectively, primarily related to brands acquired as part of the Pinnacle\nacquisition that were recorded at fair value in fiscal 2019. We continue to be\nmore susceptible to impairment charges in the future if our long-term sales\nforecasts, royalty rates, and other assumptions change as a result of lower\nthan expected performance or other economic conditions. We will monitor these\nassumptions as management continues to achieve gross margin improvement and\nlong-term sales growth. Discount rates, long-term growth rates, and royalty\nrates used to estimate the fair value of our domestic retail brands with 10%\nor less excess fair value over carrying amount as of the fiscal 2024 annual\nimpairment test were as follows:", "\u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n\u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| **Discount Rate**|  \u200b| \u200b| **Long-Term Growth Rate**|  \u200b|\n**Royalty Rate**  \n\u200b| \u200b| **Carrying Amount**|  \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b  \n\u200b| ****| **(in billions)**| ****|  \u200b| **Minimum**| ****|  \u200b| **Maximum**| ****|  \u200b| **Minimum**| ****|  \u200b| **Maximum**|  | **Minimum**|  | **Maximum**  \nBrands (<10% cushion)| \u200b| $|  1.3| \u200b| \u200b| 8.50%| \u200b| \u200b| 10.50%| \u200b| \u200b| 0.0%| \u200b|\n\u200b| 2.0%| \u200b| 1.0%| \u200b| 11.5%  \n  \n\u200b\n\nAssumptions used in impairment testing are made at a point in time and require\nsignificant judgment; therefore, they are subject to change based upon the\nfacts and circumstances present at each annual impairment test date.\nAdditionally, these assumptions are generally interdependent and do not change\nin isolation.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nThe principal market risks affecting us during fiscal 2024 and 2023 were\nexposures to price fluctuations of commodity and energy inputs, interest\nrates, and foreign currencies.\n\nCommodity Market Risk\n\nWe purchase commodity inputs such as wheat, corn, vegetable oils, pork, dairy\nproducts, and energy to be used in our operations. These commodities are\nsubject to price fluctuations that may create price risk. We enter into\ncommodity hedges to manage this price risk using physical forward contracts or\nderivative instruments. We have policies governing the hedging instruments our\nbusinesses may use. These policies include limiting the dollar risk exposure\nfor each of our businesses. We also monitor the amount of associated counter-\nparty credit risk for all non-exchange-traded transactions.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nWe may use interest rate swaps to manage the effect of interest rate changes\non the fair value of our existing debt as well as the forecasted interest\npayments for the anticipated issuance of debt.\n\nAs of May 26, 2024 and May 28, 2023, the fair value of our long-term debt\n(including current installments) was estimated at $7.26 billion and $8.31\nbillion, respectively, based on current market rates. As of May 26, 2024 and\nMay 28, 2023, a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of\nour fixed rate debt by approximately $356.6 million and $392.8 million,\nrespectively, while a 1% decrease in interest rates would increase the fair\nvalue of our fixed rate debt by approximately $400.5 million and $441.7\nmillion, respectively.\n\n36\n\nForeign Currency Risk\n\nIn order to reduce exposures for our processing activities related to changes\nin foreign currency exchange rates, we may enter into forward exchange or\noption contracts for transactions denominated in a currency other than the\nfunctional currency for certain of our operations. This activity primarily\nrelates to economically hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing\ninventory and capital equipment, sales of finished goods, and future\nsettlement of foreign denominated assets and liabilities.\n\nEffect of Hypothetical 10% Fluctuation\n\nThe potential gain or loss on the fair value of our outstanding commodity and\nforeign exchange contracts, assuming a hypothetical 10% fluctuation in\ncommodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates, would have been (in\nmillions):\n\n\u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n\u200b| \u200b| **Fair Value Impact**  \n**In Millions**| ****| **Average During the Fiscal Year Ended May 26, 2024**|\n****| **Average During the Fiscal Year Ended May 28, 2023**  \nEnergy commodities| \u200b| $|  4.4| \u200b| $|  4.5  \nAgriculture commodities| \u200b| \u200b|  4.5| \u200b| \u200b|  9.0  \nForeign exchange| \u200b| \u200b|  10.0| \u200b| \u200b|  8.7  \n  \n\u200b\n\nIt should be noted that any change in the fair value of our derivative\ncontracts, real or hypothetical, would be significantly offset by an inverse\nchange in the value of the underlying hedged items.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nFiscal Year -- The fiscal year of Conagra Brands, Inc. (\"Conagra Brands\",\n\"Company\", \"we\", \"us\", or \"our\") ends the last Sunday in May. The fiscal years\nfor the consolidated financial statements presented consist of a 52-week\nperiod for fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022.\n\nBasis of Consolidation -- The consolidated financial statements include the\naccounts of Conagra Brands, Inc. and all majority-owned subsidiaries. All\nsignificant intercompany investments, accounts, and transactions have been\neliminated.\n\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Affiliates -- The investments in, and the\noperating results of, 50%-or-less-owned entities not required to be\nconsolidated are included in the consolidated financial statements on the\nbasis of the equity method of accounting.\n\nWe review our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever\nevents or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount\nof the investments may not be fully recoverable. Evidence of a loss in value\nthat is other than temporary includes, but is not limited to, the absence of\nan ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment, the inability of\nthe investee to sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying\namount of the investment, or, where applicable, estimated sales proceeds which\nare insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the investment.\nManagement's assessment as to whether any decline in value is other than\ntemporary is based on our ability and intent to hold the investment and\nwhether evidence indicating the carrying value of the investment is\nrecoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs evidence to the\ncontrary. Management generally considers our investments in equity method\ninvestees to be strategic long-term investments. Therefore, management\ncompletes its assessments with a long-term viewpoint. If the fair value of the\ninvestment is determined to be less than the carrying value and the decline in\nvalue is considered to be other than temporary, an appropriate write-down is\nrecorded based on the excess of the carrying value over the best estimate of\nfair value of the investment.\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents -- Cash and all highly liquid investments with an\noriginal maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition,\nincluding short-term time deposits and government agency and corporate\nobligations, are classified as cash and cash equivalents.\n\nReceivables -- Receivables from customers generally do not bear interest.\nTerms and collection vary by location and channel. The allowance for doubtful\naccounts represents our estimate of probable non-payments and credit losses in\nour existing receivables, as determined based on a review of past due balances\nand other specific account data. Account balances are written off against the\nallowance when we deem them uncollectible.\n\nThe following table details the balances of our allowance for doubtful\naccounts and changes therein:\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n\u200b| \u200b| **Balance at**|  \u200b| \u200b| **Additions Charged**|  \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b  \n\u200b| \u200b| **Beginning of**|  \u200b| \u200b| **to Costs and**|  \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| **Deductions\nfrom**|  \u200b| **Balance at Close**  \n\u200b| **** \u200b| **Period**| **** \u200b| \u200b| **Expenses**| **** \u200b| \u200b| **Other** 1| ****\n\u200b| **Reserves** 2| **** \u200b| **of Period**  \nYear ended May 26, 2024| \u200b| $|  2.7| \u200b| \u200b|  0.6| \u200b| \u200b|  0.2| \u200b|  0.5| \u200b| $|\n3.0  \nYear ended May 28, 20233| \u200b| $|  2.8| \u200b| \u200b|  0.1| \u200b| \u200b|  (0.1)| \u200b|  0.1| \u200b| $|\n2.7  \nYear ended May 29, 20223| \u200b| $|  2.0| \u200b| \u200b|  1.4| \u200b| \u200b|  --| \u200b|  0.6| \u200b| $|\n2.8  \n  \n1 Primarily relates to translation.", "2 Bad debts charged off and adjustments to previous reserves, less recoveries.\n\n3 Prior year amounts have been adjusted to remove the activity of a business\nheld for sale.\n\nInventories -- We use the lower of cost (determined using the first-in, first-\nout method) or net realizable value for valuing inventories.\n\n43\n\n**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n**Fiscal Years Ended May 26, 2024, May 28, 2023, and May 29, 2022**\n\n**(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)**\n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment -- Property, plant and equipment are carried at\ncost. Depreciation has been calculated using the straight-line method over the\nestimated useful lives of the respective classes of assets as follows:\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b  \n---|---|---|---  \n\u200b|  \u200b| Years  \nLand improvements| \u200b| \u200b| 1 \\- 40  \nBuildings| \u200b| \u200b| 15 \\- 40  \nMachinery and equipment| \u200b| \u200b| 3 \\- 20  \nFurniture, fixtures, office equipment and other| \u200b| \u200b| 5 \\- 15  \n  \n\u200b\n\nWe review property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or\nchanges in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the\nassets may not be fully recoverable. Recoverability of an asset considered\n\"held-and-used\" is determined by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to\nthe undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the\nasset. If the carrying amount is greater than the undiscounted net cash flows\nexpected to be generated by the asset, the asset's carrying amount is reduced\nto its estimated fair value. An asset considered \"held-for-sale\" is reported\nat the lower of the asset's carrying amount or fair value.\n\nDuring fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, our capital expenditures totaled $388.1\nmillion, $362.2 million, and $464.4 million, respectively. Accrued and unpaid\ncapital expenditures as of May 26, 2024, May 28, 2023, May 29, 2022, and May\n30, 2021 totaled $119.3 million, $128.3 million, $108.8 million, and $123.7\nmillion, respectively.\n\nGoodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets -- Goodwill and other\nidentifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives (e.g., brands or\ntrademarks) are not amortized and are tested annually for impairment of value\nand whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount\nof the asset may be impaired. A significant amount of judgment is involved in\ndetermining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may\ninclude deterioration in general economic conditions, adverse changes in the\nmarkets in which an entity operates, increases in input costs that have\nnegative effects on earnings and cash flows, or a trend of negative or\ndeclining cash flows over multiple periods, among others. The fair value that\ncould be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to\nevaluate the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets.\n\nIn testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first assess\nqualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or\ncircumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (more\nthan 50%) that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its\ncarrying amount. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine\nthat an impairment is more likely than not, we are then required to perform a\nquantitative impairment test, otherwise no further analysis is required. We\nalso may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed\ndirectly to the quantitative impairment test.\n\nUnder the goodwill qualitative assessment, various events and circumstances\nthat would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified\n(similar to impairment indicators above). Furthermore, management considers\nthe results of the most recent quantitative impairment test completed for a\nreporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital between the\ncurrent and prior years for each reporting unit.", "Under the goodwill quantitative impairment test, the evaluation of impairment\ninvolves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its\ncarrying value, including goodwill. We estimate the fair value using level 3\ninputs as defined by the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 19 for the\ndefinition of the levels in the fair value hierarchy. The inputs used to\ncalculate the fair value include a number of subjective factors, such as\nestimates of future cash flows, estimates of our future cost structure,\ndiscount rates for our estimated cash flows, required level of working\ncapital, assumed terminal value, and time horizon of cash flow forecasts. In\ncertain circumstances, we also utilize a guideline public company method which\nis based on market multiples and our estimated earnings before interest,\ntaxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") that considers public\ncompanies that are comparable to our reporting units.\n\nIn assessing indefinite-lived intangible assets not subject to amortization\nfor impairment, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to\ndetermine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a\ndetermination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of such an\nintangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If we determine that it is\nnot more likely than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is\nless than its carrying amount, then we are not required to perform any\nadditional tests for assessing intangible assets for impairment. However, if\nwe conclude otherwise or elect not to perform the qualitative assessment, then\nwe are required to perform a quantitative impairment test that involves a\ncomparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset\n\n44\n\n**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n**Fiscal Years Ended May 26, 2024, May 28, 2023, and May 29, 2022**\n\n**(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)**\n\nwith its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds\nits fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that\nexcess.\n\nIn fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022 we elected to perform a quantitative impairment\ntest for indefinite-lived intangible assets not subject to amortization. The\nestimates of fair value of intangible assets not subject to amortization are\ndetermined using a \"relief from royalty\" methodology, which is used in\nestimating the fair value of our brands/trademarks. Discount rate assumptions\nare based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the projected future cash\nflows generated by the respective intangible assets. Also subject to judgment\nare assumptions about royalty rates.\n\nIdentifiable intangible assets with definite lives (e.g., licensing\narrangements with contractual lives or customer relationships) are amortized\nover their estimated useful lives and tested for impairment whenever events or\nchanges in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may be\nimpaired. Identifiable intangible assets with definite lives are evaluated for\nimpairment using a process similar to that used in evaluating elements of\nproperty, plant and equipment. If impaired, the asset is written down to its\nfair value.\n\nRefer to Note 8 for discussion of the impairment charges related to goodwill\nand intangible assets in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022.\n\nFair Values of Financial Instruments -- Unless otherwise specified, we believe\nthe carrying value of financial instruments approximates their fair value.", "Fair Values of Financial Instruments -- Unless otherwise specified, we believe\nthe carrying value of financial instruments approximates their fair value.\n\nEnvironmental Liabilities -- Environmental liabilities are accrued when it is\nprobable that obligations have been incurred and the associated amounts can be\nreasonably estimated. We use third-party specialists to assist management in\nappropriately measuring the obligations associated with environmental\nliabilities. Such liabilities are adjusted as new information develops or\ncircumstances change. We do not discount our environmental liabilities as the\ntiming of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable.\nManagement's estimate of our potential liability is independent of any\npotential recovery of insurance proceeds or indemnification arrangements. We\ndo not reduce our environmental liabilities for potential insurance\nrecoveries.\n\nEmployment-Related Benefits -- Employment-related benefits associated with\npensions, postretirement health care benefits, and workers' compensation are\nexpensed as such obligations are incurred. The recognition of expense is\nimpacted by estimates made by management, such as discount rates used to value\nthese liabilities, future health care costs, and employee accidents incurred\nbut not yet reported. We use third-party specialists to assist management in\nappropriately measuring the obligations associated with employment-related\nbenefits.\n\nWe recognize changes in the fair value of pension plan assets and net\nactuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the market-\nrelated value of plan assets or the plan's projected benefit obligation (the\n\"corridor\") in current period expense annually as of our measurement date,\nwhich is our fiscal year-end, or when measurement is required otherwise under\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America\n(\"U.S. GAAP\").\n\nRevenue Recognition -- Our revenues primarily consist of the sale of food\nproducts that are sold to retailers and foodservice customers through direct\nsales forces, broker, and distributor arrangements. These revenue contracts\ngenerally have single performance obligations. Revenue, which includes\nshipping and handling charges billed to the customer, is reported net of\nvariable consideration and consideration payable to our customers, including\napplicable discounts, returns, allowances, trade promotion, consumer coupon\nredemption, unsaleable product, and other costs. Amounts billed and due from\nour customers are classified as receivables and require payment on a short-\nterm basis and, therefore, we do not have any significant financing\ncomponents.\n\nWe recognize revenue when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied by\ntransferring control of the goods to customers. Control is transferred upon\ndelivery of the goods to the customer. Shipping and/or handling costs that\noccur before the customer obtains control of the goods are deemed to be\nfulfillment activities and are accounted for as fulfillment costs. We assess\nthe goods and services promised in our customers' purchase orders and identify\na performance obligation for each promise to transfer a good or service (or\nbundle of goods or services) that is distinct.\n\n45\n\n**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n**Fiscal Years Ended May 26, 2024, May 28, 2023, and May 29, 2022**\n\n**(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)**", "45\n\n**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n**Fiscal Years Ended May 26, 2024, May 28, 2023, and May 29, 2022**\n\n**(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)**\n\nWe offer various forms of trade promotions and the methodologies for\ndetermining these provisions are dependent on local customer pricing and\npromotional practices, which range from contractually fixed percentage price\nreductions to provisions based on actual occurrence or performance. Our\npromotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or\ndirectly with consumers and include activities such as in-store displays and\nevents, feature price discounts, consumer coupons, and loyalty programs. The\ncosts of these activities are recognized at the time the related revenue is\nrecorded, which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure. The recognition\nof these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of\npromotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or\nconsumer. These estimates are made using various techniques including\nhistorical data on performance of similar promotional programs. Differences\nbetween estimated expense and actual redemptions are recognized as a change in\nmanagement estimate in a subsequent period.\n\nAdvertising Costs -- Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.

The fair value of our indefinite-lived\nintangibles is determined using the \"relief from royalty\" methodology. Both\nthe \"relief from royalty\" methodology and the discounted cash flow method\nrequire us to estimate the future cash flows as well as to select a risk-\nadjusted discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash\nflows. The guideline public company method is based on our actual and\nestimated EBITDA and considers public companies that are comparable to our\nreporting units. When determining future cash flow estimates, we consider\nhistorical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating\nconditions. Under our discounted cash flow method, we estimate cash flows for\na reporting unit over a discrete period (typically five years) and a terminal\nperiod (considering expected long-term growth rates and trends). Estimating\nthe fair value of individual reporting units and our indefinite-lived\nintangible assets requires us to make assumptions and estimates in areas such\nas future economic conditions, industry-specific conditions, product pricing,\nand necessary capital expenditures. The use of different assumptions or\nestimates for selected EBITDA multiples, future cash flows, discount rates, or\nterminal growth rates could produce substantially different estimates of the\nfair value.\n\n53\n\n**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n**Fiscal Years Ended May 26, 2024, May 28, 2023, and May 29, 2022**\n\n**(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)**\n\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we performed our annual goodwill\nimpairment assessment on all of our reporting units. We completed a\nqualitative assessment on all of our reporting units with the exception of our\nSides, Components, Enhancers reporting unit. Our qualitative assessment found\nno indicators of impairment and considered, among other things, our previous\ncushion from our last quantitative test, moderating inflation, and improved\noperating margins due in part to our productivity initiatives. We will\ncontinue to evaluate the impact of any significant changes in consumer\npurchasing behaviors, government restrictions, input cost inflation, or other\nmacroeconomic conditions that could change certain assumptions and result in\nfuture impairments.", "We completed a quantitative impairment test for our Sides, Components,\nEnhancers reporting unit with the assistance of a third-party valuation\nspecialist using both a discounted cash flow method and guideline public\ncompany method in the current year as a result of lower market multiples in\nour industry as of our testing date. In estimating the fair value of this\nreporting unit, we selected a market multiple of 9.0- 9.5x using actual and\nestimated EBITDA for our guideline public company method. We used a discount\nrate of 8.50% and a terminal growth rate that approximated 1% for our\ndiscounted cash flow approach. As a result of our impairment test, we\nrecognized goodwill impairment charges within SG&A expenses of $526.5 million.\nThe impairments were largely due to the 75-basis point increase in the\ndiscount rate as a result of current economic conditions (higher interest\nrates and a slightly higher company specific risk premium), a decline in\nmarket capitalization, lower market multiples in our industry as of our\ntesting date, as well as a downward revision to our sales forecasts for this\nspecific reporting unit. After these impairments, the goodwill carrying amount\nof our Sides, Components, Enhancers reporting unit is approximately $1.4\nbillion. Accumulated impairment losses to goodwill associated with this\nreporting unit were $668.2 million as of May 26, 2024 and $141.7 million as of\nMay 28, 2023.\n\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2023, management reorganized its reporting\nstructure for certain brands within two reporting units in our Refrigerated &\nFrozen segment. The change in management reporting required us to reassign\nassets and liabilities, including goodwill, between the reporting units,\ncomplete a goodwill impairment test both prior to and subsequent to the\nchange, and evaluate other assets in the reporting units for impairment,\nincluding indefinite-lived intangibles (brand names and trademarks). The fair\nvalue of our indefinite-lived intangibles was determined using the \"relief\nfrom royalty\" methodology. As a result of our impairment tests, we recognized\ngoodwill impairment charges within SG&A expenses of $141.7 million within our\nSides, Components, Enhancers reporting unit in the first quarter of fiscal\n2023. In addition, we recognized an impairment charge within SG&A expenses of\n$244.0 million related to our _Birds Eye_ \u00ae brand name in the first quarter of\nfiscal 2023.\n\n\u200b\n\nAmortizing intangible assets, carrying a remaining weighted-average life of\napproximately 17 years, are principally composed of customer relationships and\nacquired intellectual property. For fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, we recognized\namortization expense of $53.6 million, $56.8 million, and $59.3 million,\nrespectively. Based on amortizing assets recognized in our Consolidated\nBalance Sheet as of May 26, 2024, amortization expense for the next five years\nis estimated to be as follows:\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b  \n---|---|---|---  \n2025|  \u200b| $|  53.5  \n2026| \u200b| \u200b|  43.5  \n2027| \u200b| \u200b|  43.3  \n2028| \u200b| \u200b|  40.8  \n2029| \u200b| \u200b|  39.6  \n  \n\u200b", "\u200b\n\n\u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b  \n---|---|---|---  \n2025|  \u200b| $|  53.5  \n2026| \u200b| \u200b|  43.5  \n2027| \u200b| \u200b|  43.3  \n2028| \u200b| \u200b|  40.8  \n2029| \u200b| \u200b|  39.6  \n  \n\u200b\n\nFor our non-amortizing intangible assets, which are comprised of brands and\ntrademarks, we use a \"relief from royalty\" methodology in estimating fair\nvalue. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, as a result of our annual\nimpairment test for indefinite lived intangibles, we recognized impairment\ncharges in SG&A expenses of $430.2 million within our Grocery & Snacks and\nRefrigerated & Frozen segments. All brands were negatively impacted by an\nincrease in our discount rate in response to the current economic environment\n(higher interest rates including an increase in certain brand specific risk\npremiums) since our last annual impairment test. Our two largest impairments\nwere related to _Birds Eye_ \u00ae and _Earth Balance_ \u00ae in the amount of $255.4\nmillion and $72.1 million, respectively. Both of these brands were negatively\nimpacted by volume declines in the current fiscal year given recent\nconsumption trends, which also resulted in revised sales growth expectations.\n_Birds Eye_ \u00ae was also negatively impacted by lower than expected profit\nmargins which resulted in a slight reduction to our assumed royalty rate.\n\nDuring fiscal 2023, as a result of our annual impairment test for indefinite\nlived intangibles, we recognized impairment charges in SG&A expenses of $345.2\nmillion, primarily within our Grocery & Snacks and Refrigerated & Frozen\nsegments.

Our two largest impairments were related to _Gardein_ \u00ae and _Birds Eye_\n\u00ae in the amount of $91.5 million and $78.3 million, respectively. Both of\nthese brands were negatively impacted by lower than expected profit margins\nwhich resulted in a reduction to our assumed royalty rates in addition to\nrevised sales growth expectations to be consistent with recent industry\ntrends. Including the _Birds Eye_ \u00ae brand impairment recognized in the first\nquarter of fiscal 2023, discussed above, our total brand impairment charges\nrecognized in fiscal 2023 were $589.2 million.\n\nDuring fiscal 2022, as a result of our annual impairment test for indefinite\nlived intangibles, we recognized impairment charges in SG&A expenses of $209.0\nmillion, primarily within our Grocery & Snacks and Refrigerated & Frozen\nsegments. _Duncan Hines_ \u00ae and _Gardein_ \u00ae were the most notable brands with\nimpairments largely due to lower than expected profit margins which resulted\nin a reduction to our assumed royalty rates along with increases in our\ndiscount rate.\n\n9\\.

We repurchased 4.2 million shares of our common stock\nfor approximately $150.0 million in fiscal 2023 and 1.5 million shares of our\ncommon stock for approximately $50.0 million in fiscal 2022.\n\n13\\. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS\n\nIn accordance with stockholder-approved equity incentive plans, we grant\nstock-based compensation awards, including restricted stock units, performance\nshares, performance-based restricted stock units, and stock options. The\nshares delivered upon vesting or lapse of restriction under any such\narrangement may consist, in whole or part, of treasury stock or authorized but\nunissued stock, not reserved for any other purpose.", "On September 14, 2023, our stockholders approved the Conagra Brands, Inc. 2023\nStock Plan (the \"Plan\"). The Plan authorizes the issuance of up to 17.4\nmillion shares of Conagra Brands common stock. In addition to the shares under\nthe 2023 Stock Plan, certain shares of Conagra Brands common stock subject to\noutstanding awards under predecessor stock plans that expire, lapse, are\ncancelled, terminated, forfeited, otherwise become unexercisable, or are\nsettled for cash are available for issuance. At May 26, 2024, approximately\n14.9 million shares were reserved for granting new share-based awards.\n\nShare Unit Awards\n\nIn accordance with stockholder-approved equity incentive plans, we grant\nawards of restricted stock units (\"share units\") to employees and directors.\nThese awards generally have requisite service periods of three years. Under\neach such award, stock is issued without direct cost to the employee. We\nestimate the fair value of the share units based upon the market price of our\nstock at the date of grant. Certain share unit grants do not provide for the\npayment of dividend equivalents to the participant during the requisite\nservice period (the \"vesting period\"). For those grants, the value of the\ngrants is reduced by the net present value of the foregone dividend equivalent\npayments.\n\nWe recognize compensation expense for share unit awards on a straight-line\nbasis over the requisite service period, accounting for forfeitures as they\noccur. The compensation expense for our stock-settled share unit awards\ntotaled $38.5 million, $34.2 million, and $25.8 million for fiscal 2024, 2023,\nand 2022, respectively. The tax benefit related to the stock-settled share\nunit award compensation expense for fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $7.7\nmillion, $6.2 million, and $5.3 million, respectively.\n\n56\n\n**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n**Fiscal Years Ended May 26, 2024, May 28, 2023, and May 29, 2022**\n\n**(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)**\n\nThe following table summarizes the nonvested share units as of May 26, 2024\nand changes during the fiscal year then ended:\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n\u200b| \u200b| **Stock-Settled**  \n\u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| **Weighted**  \n\u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| **Average**  \n\u200b| \u200b| **Share Units**|  \u200b| **Grant-Date**  \n**Share Units**| ****| **(in Millions)**| ****| **Fair Value**  \nNonvested share units at May 28, 2023| \u200b| \u200b|  2.83| \u200b| $|  34.23  \nGranted| \u200b| \u200b|  1.96| \u200b| $|  30.20  \nVested/Issued| \u200b| \u200b|  (0.89)| \u200b| $|  35.75  \nForfeited| \u200b| \u200b|  (0.25)| \u200b| $|  33.08  \nNonvested share units at May 26, 2024| \u200b| \u200b|  3.65| \u200b| $|  33.01  \n  \n\u200b\n\nDuring fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, we granted 2.0 million, 1.6 million, and\n1.1 million stock-settled share units, respectively, with a weighted average\ngrant date fair value of $30.20, $33.28, and $34.26 per share unit,\nrespectively.\n\nThe total intrinsic value of stock-settled share units vested was $28.3\nmillion, $34.7 million, and $26.9 million during fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022,\nrespectively.\n\nAt May 26, 2024, we had $44.8 million of total unrecognized compensation\nexpense that will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.8 years\nrelated to stock-settled share unit awards.\n\nPerformance Share Awards", "Performance Share Awards\n\nPerformance shares are granted to selected executives and other key employees\nwith vesting contingent upon meeting various Company-wide performance goals.\nThe performance goal for the three-year performance period ending in fiscal\n2024 (the \"2024 performance period\") was based on our diluted earnings per\nshare (\"EPS\") compound annual growth rate, subject to certain adjustments,\nmeasured over the defined performance period.

Subject to\nlimited exceptions set forth in our performance share plan, any shares earned\nwill be distributed after the end of the performance period, and generally\nonly if the participant continues to be employed with the Company through the\ndate of distribution. For awards where performance against the performance\ntarget has not been certified, the value of the performance shares is adjusted\nbased upon the market price of our common stock and current forecasted\nperformance against the performance targets at the end of each reporting\nperiod and amortized as compensation expense over the vesting period.\nForfeitures are accounted for as they occur.\n\nA summary of the activity for performance share awards as of May 26, 2024 and\nchanges during the fiscal year then ended is presented below:\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n\u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| **Weighted**  \n\u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| **Average**  \n\u200b| \u200b| **Share Units**|  \u200b| **Grant-Date**  \n**Performance Shares**| ****| **(in Millions)**| ****| **Fair Value**  \nNonvested performance shares at May 28, 2023| \u200b| \u200b|  1.57| \u200b| $|  34.39  \nGranted| \u200b| \u200b|  0.89| \u200b| $|  32.57  \nAdjustments for performance results attained and dividend equivalents| \u200b| \u200b|\n0.28| \u200b| $|  36.81  \nVested/Issued| \u200b| \u200b|  (0.69)| \u200b| $|  36.81  \nForfeited| \u200b| \u200b|  (0.07)| \u200b| $|  32.93  \nNonvested performance shares at May 26, 2024| \u200b| \u200b|  1.98| \u200b| $|  33.11  \n  \n57\n\n**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n**Fiscal Years Ended May 26, 2024, May 28, 2023, and May 29, 2022**\n\n**(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)**\n\n\u200b\n\nWe recognized a benefit of $7.7 million, expense of $45.0 million, and a\nbenefit of $1.4 million for our performance share awards in fiscal 2024, 2023,\nand 2022, respectively.

Other major jurisdictions where\nwe conduct business generally have statutes of limitations ranging from three\nto five years.\n\nWe estimate that it is reasonably possible that the amount of gross\nunrecognized tax benefits will decrease by up to $14.3 million over the next\ntwelve months due to various federal, state, and foreign audit settlements and\nthe expiration of statutes of limitations.\n\nThe change in the unrecognized tax benefits for the fiscal years ended May 26,\n2024 and May 28, 2023 was as follows:\n\n\u200b", "The change in the unrecognized tax benefits for the fiscal years ended May 26,\n2024 and May 28, 2023 was as follows:\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n\u200b|  | **May 26, 2024**| ****| **May 28, 2023**  \nBeginning balance| \u200b| $|  23.7| \u200b| $|  62.9  \nIncreases from positions established during prior periods| \u200b| \u200b|  0.3| \u200b| \u200b|\n0.3  \nDecreases from positions established during prior periods| \u200b| \u200b|  --| \u200b| \u200b|\n(32.3)  \nIncreases from positions established during the current period| \u200b| \u200b|  1.9| \u200b|\n\u200b|  1.7  \nReductions resulting from lapse of applicable statute of limitation| \u200b| \u200b|\n(4.3)| \u200b| \u200b|  (8.9)  \nDecrease from audit settlements| \u200b| \u200b|  --| \u200b| \u200b|  (0.1)  \nOther adjustments to liability| \u200b| \u200b|  0.1| \u200b| \u200b|  0.1  \nEnding balance| \u200b| $|  21.7| \u200b| $|  23.7  \n  \n\u200b\n\nWe have approximately $22.8 million of foreign net operating loss\ncarryforwards ($22.6 million will expire between fiscal 2029 and 2044 and $0.2\nmillion have no expiration dates) and $51.3 million of federal net operating\nloss carryforwards which expire in fiscal 2027. Included in net deferred tax\nliabilities are $21.5 million of tax effected state net operating loss\ncarryforwards which expire in various years ranging from fiscal 2025 to 2044\nand $2.2 million of tax effected state capital loss balances that expire in\nfiscal year 2027 through 2037. Foreign tax credits of $7.8 million will expire\nbetween fiscal 2027 and 2034. State tax credits of approximately $3.4 million\nwill expire in various years ranging from fiscal 2025 to 2031.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we reflected additional tax expense of $25.0 million related\nto tax elections made in conjunction with filing our fiscal 2021 federal tax\nreturn. These elections are still under review with the IRS. These elections\nmay result in increases to the tax basis in those assets and if successful\nwould result in tax benefits being realized in future periods.\n\nWe have recognized a valuation allowance for the portion of the net operating\nloss carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards, and\nother deferred tax assets we believe are not more likely than not to be\nrealized. The net change in the valuation allowance for fiscal 2024 was a\ndecrease of $0.4 million, principally related to a decrease in valuation\nallowances related to state attributes. The net change in the valuation\nallowance for fiscal 2023 was an increase of $2.1 million.\n\nWe have previously made the assessment that the current earnings of certain\nforeign subsidiaries were not indefinitely reinvested or that we could not\nremit to the U.S. parent in a tax-neutral transaction. Accordingly, we have\nrecorded a deferred tax liability of $16.8 million on approximately $335.8\nmillion of earnings at May 26, 2024. The deferred tax liability relates to\nlocal withholding taxes that will be owed when this cash is distributed. The\nundistributed historic earnings in our foreign subsidiaries through May 30,\n2021 are considered to be indefinitely reinvested or can be remitted in a tax-\nneutral transaction. Accordingly, we have not recorded a deferred tax\nliability related to these undistributed historic earnings.\n\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was signed into law.\nWe have determined that we are not subject to the corporate alternative\nminimum tax at this time.\n\n15\\. LEASES\n\nWe have operating and finance leases of certain warehouses, plants, land,\noffice space, production and distribution equipment, automobiles, and office\nequipment. We determine whether an agreement is or contains a lease at lease\ninception. Right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets represent our right to use an\nunderlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our\nobligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.\n\n60\n\n**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n**Fiscal Years Ended May 26, 2024, May 28, 2023, and May 29, 2022**\n\n**(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)**", "60\n\n**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n**Fiscal Years Ended May 26, 2024, May 28, 2023, and May 29, 2022**\n\n**(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)**\n\nAs most of our leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, we calculate\nthe lease liability at lease commencement as the present value of unpaid lease\npayments using our estimated incremental borrowing rate. The incremental\nborrowing rate represents the rate of interest that we would have to pay to\nborrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a\nsimilar term and is determined using a portfolio approach based on information\navailable at the commencement date of the lease.\n\nWe have elected not to separate lease and non-lease components of an agreement\nfor all underlying asset classes prospectively from the ASU 2016-02, _Leases,\nTopic 842_ adoption date.\n\nAny lease arrangements with an initial term of twelve months or less are not\nrecorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We recognize lease cost for these\nlease arrangements on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nOur lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. We\nconsider these options in determining the lease term used to establish our ROU\nasset and lease liabilities. A limited number of our lease agreements include\nrental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. Our lease agreements do\nnot contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive\ncovenants.\n\nDuring fiscal 2024, we took control of a third-party distribution facility\nthat was assessed to be a finance lease. At lease commencement, the term of\nthe lease was 20 years with a discount rate of 5.42%. As a result, we recorded\na $165.3 million finance lease right-of-use asset reflected in property, plant\nand equipment along with a corresponding finance lease obligation reflected in\nlong-term debt

CONTINGENCIES\n\nLitigation Matters\n\nWe are a party to certain litigation matters relating to our acquisition of\nBeatrice Company (\"Beatrice\") in fiscal 1991, including litigation proceedings\nrelated to businesses divested by Beatrice prior to our acquisition. These\nproceedings have included suits against a number of lead-based paint and\npigment manufacturers, including ConAgra Grocery Products Company, LLC, a\nwholly owned subsidiary of the Company (\"ConAgra Grocery Products\"), as\nalleged successor to W. P. Fuller & Co., a lead-based paint and pigment\nmanufacturer owned and operated by a predecessor to Beatrice from 1962 until\n1967. These lawsuits have generally sought damages for personal injury,\nproperty damage, economic loss, and governmental expenditures allegedly caused\nby the use of lead-based paint, and/or injunctive relief for inspection and\nabatement. ConAgra Grocery Products has denied liability, both on the merits\nof the claims and on the basis that we do not believe it to be the successor\nto any liability attributable to W. P. Fuller & Co. Pursuant to the settlement\nof a consolidated lead-based paint and pigment related action in California in\n2019, ConAgra Grocery Products is responsible for payments totaling $101.7\nmillion, payable in seven annual installments from fiscal 2020 through fiscal\n2026, of which $73.0 million had been paid as of May 26, 2024. As part of the\nsettlement, ConAgra Grocery Products has also provided a guarantee of up to\n$15.0 million in the event co-defendant, NL Industries, Inc., defaults on its\npayment obligations.

These lawsuits generally seek damages for personal\ninjuries allegedly caused by defects in the design, manufacture, or safety\nwarnings of our cooking spray products. In these lawsuits, we have denied\nliability, however, we cannot predict with certainty the results of these\nproceedings. The Company believes adequate provision has been made in its\nConsolidated Financial Statements for all probable and reasonably estimable\nlosses for the litigation related to the cooking spray products based on\ninformation available to us at the time of our evaluation. Additionally, we\nhave put the applicable insurance carriers on notice of these cooking spray\nmatters and have recognized a related insurance receivable of $14.7 million\n($7.1 million within receivables and $7.6 million within other assets) as of\nMay 26, 2024 in connection with a settlement agreement with one of these\ninsurance carriers. During fiscal 2024, a jury entered a verdict against the\nCompany for $3.1 million in compensatory damages and $4.0 million in punitive\ndamages in one of these cooking spray related lawsuits captioned _Reese v.\nConagra Brands, Inc., et al. ( \"Reese\")_. We have appealed the judgment in the\n_Reese_ lawsuit.\n\nWe are party to a number of putative class action lawsuits challenging various\nproduct claims made in the Company's product labeling, and matter challenging\nthe Company's wage and hour practices. While we cannot predict with certainty\nthe results of the remaining claims or any other legal proceedings, we do not\nexpect these matters to have a material adverse effect on our financial\ncondition, results of operations, or business.", "Our accrual for all litigation matters, including those matters described\nabove that are probable and estimable, was $76.3 million ($30.4 million within\nother accrued liabilities and $45.9 million within other noncurrent\nliabilities) as of May 26, 2024 and $51.3 million ($22.4 million within other\naccrued liabilities and $28.9 million within other noncurrent liabilities) as\nof May 28, 2023.\n\nEnvironmental Matters\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") regulations require us to\ndisclose certain information about environmental proceedings if a governmental\nauthority is a party to such proceedings and such proceedings involve\npotential monetary sanctions that we reasonably believe will exceed a stated\nthreshold. Pursuant to the SEC regulations, the Company uses a threshold of\n$1.0 million for purposes of determining whether disclosure of any such\nproceedings is required.\n\nIn October 2019, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (\"MPCA\") initiated an\nodor complaint investigation at our Waseca, Minnesota vegetable processing\nfacility. As a result of the investigation, the MPCA required implementation\nof a continuous monitoring system running from May 1 to October 31 in 2020 and\n2021 and from April 1 to October 31 in 2022 to monitor hydrogen sulfide\nemissions at the wastewater treatment facility. As a result of the monitoring\ndata findings, the MPCA has alleged violations of Minnesota Ambient Air\nQuality Standards based on our hydrogen sulfide emissions during calendar\nyears 2020, 2021, and 2022. In August 2023, the parties entered into a\nsettlement agreement with a penalty amount of $1.25 million for all of the\nalleged violations.\n\nWe are a party to certain environmental proceedings relating to businesses\ndivested by Beatrice prior to our acquisition in fiscal 1991, including\nlitigation and administrative proceedings involving Beatrice's possible status\nas a potentially responsible party at approximately 35 Superfund, proposed\nSuperfund, or state-equivalent sites (the \"Beatrice sites\"). The Beatrice\nsites consist of locations previously owned or operated by predecessors of\nBeatrice that used or produced petroleum, pesticides, fertilizers, dyes, inks,\nsolvents, polychlorinated biphenyls, acids, lead, sulfur, tannery wastes,\nand/or other contaminants. Reserves for these Beatrice environmental\nproceedings have been established based on our best estimate of the\nundiscounted remediation liabilities, which estimates include evaluation of\ninvestigatory studies, extent of required clean-up, the known volumetric\ncontribution of Beatrice and other potentially responsible parties, and its\nexperience in remediating sites. The accrual for Beatrice-related\nenvironmental matters totaled $39.3 million ($3.3 million within other accrued\nliabilities and $36.0 million within other noncurrent liabilities) as of May\n26, 2024 and $40.1 million ($1.5 million within other accrued liabilities and\n$38.6 million within other noncurrent liabilities) as of May 28, 2023, a\nmajority of which relates to the Superfund and state-equivalent sites\nreferenced above.\n\nGeneral\n\nAfter taking into account liabilities recognized for all of the foregoing\nmatters, management believes the ultimate resolution of such matters should\nnot have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of\noperations, or liquidity; however, it is\n\n63\n\n**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n**Fiscal Years Ended May 26, 2024, May 28, 2023, and May 29, 2022**\n\n**(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)**\n\nreasonably possible that a change of the estimates of any of the foregoing\nmatters may occur in the future that could have a material adverse effect on\nour financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.\n\nCosts of legal services associated with the foregoing matters are recognized\nwithin SG&A expenses as services are provided.\n\n17\\. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS", "Costs of legal services associated with the foregoing matters are recognized\nwithin SG&A expenses as services are provided.\n\n17\\. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\nOur operations are exposed to market risks from adverse changes in commodity\nprices affecting the cost of raw materials and energy, foreign currency\nexchange rates, and interest rates. In the normal course of business, these\nrisks are managed through a variety of strategies, including the use of\nderivatives.\n\nCommodity futures and option contracts are used from time to time to\neconomically hedge commodity input prices on items such as natural gas,\nvegetable oils, proteins, packaging materials, dairy, grains, diesel fuel and\nelectricity. Generally, we economically hedge a portion of our anticipated\nconsumption of commodity inputs for periods of up to 36 months. We may enter\ninto longer-term economic hedges on particular commodities, if deemed\nappropriate. As of May 26, 2024, we had economically hedged certain portions\nof our anticipated consumption of commodity inputs using derivative\ninstruments with expiration dates through December 2024.\n\nIn order to reduce exposures related to changes in foreign currency exchange\nrates, we enter into forward exchange, option, or swap contracts from time to\ntime for transactions denominated in a currency other than the applicable\nfunctional currency. This includes, but is not limited to, hedging against\nforeign currency risk in purchasing inventory and capital equipment, sales of\nfinished goods, and future settlement of foreign-denominated assets and\nliabilities. As of May 26, 2024, we had economically hedged certain portions\nof our foreign currency risk in anticipated transactions using derivative\ninstruments with expiration dates through February 2025.\n\nFrom time to time, we may use derivative instruments, including interest rate\nswaps, to reduce risk related to changes in interest rates. This includes, but\nis not limited to, hedging against increasing interest rates prior to the\nissuance of long-term debt and hedging the fair value of our senior long-term\ndebt.\n\nDerivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedges\n\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we entered into deal-contingent\nforward starting interest rate swap contracts to hedge a portion of the\ninterest rate risk related to our issuance of long-term debt to help finance\nthe acquisition of Pinnacle. We settled these contracts during the second\nquarter of fiscal 2019 and deferred a $47.5 million gain in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income that is being amortized as a reduction of interest\nexpense over the lives of the related debt instruments. The unamortized amount\nat May 26, 2024 was $28.0 million.\n\nEconomic Hedges of Forecasted Cash Flows\n\nMany of our derivatives do not qualify for, and we do not currently designate\ncertain commodity or foreign currency derivatives to achieve, hedge accounting\ntreatment. We reflect realized and unrealized gains and losses from\nderivatives used to economically hedge anticipated commodity consumption and\nto mitigate foreign currency cash flow risk in earnings immediately within\ngeneral corporate expense (within cost of goods sold). The gains and losses\nare reclassified to segment operating results in the period in which the\nunderlying item being economically hedged is recognized in cost of goods sold.\nIn the event that management determines a particular derivative entered into\nas an economic hedge of a forecasted commodity purchase has ceased to function\nas an economic hedge, we cease recognizing further gains and losses on such\nderivatives in corporate expense and begin recognizing such gains and losses\nwithin segment operating results immediately.\n\n64\n\n**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n**Fiscal Years Ended May 26, 2024, May 28, 2023, and May 29, 2022**\n\n**(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)**", "64\n\n**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n**Fiscal Years Ended May 26, 2024, May 28, 2023, and May 29, 2022**\n\n**(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)**\n\nThe following table presents the net derivative gains (losses) from economic\nhedges of forecasted commodity consumption and the foreign currency risk of\ncertain forecasted transactions, under this methodology:\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n\u200b|  | **2024**|  | **2023**|  | **2022**  \nNet derivative gains (losses) incurred| \u200b| $|  2.9| \u200b| $|  (17.6)| \u200b| $|  37.1  \nLess: Net derivative gains (losses) allocated to reporting segments| \u200b| \u200b|\n(13.2)| \u200b| \u200b|  19.5| \u200b| \u200b|  32.7  \nNet derivative gains (losses) recognized in general corporate expenses| \u200b| $|\n16.1| \u200b| $|  (37.1)| \u200b| $|  4.4  \nNet derivative gains (losses) allocated to Grocery & Snacks| \u200b| $|  (6.1)| \u200b|\n$|  6.0| \u200b| $|  17.3  \nNet derivative gains (losses) allocated to Refrigerated & Frozen| \u200b| \u200b|\n(1.2)| \u200b| \u200b|  9.6| \u200b| \u200b|  17.4  \nNet derivative gains (losses) allocated to International| \u200b| \u200b|  (5.6)| \u200b| \u200b|\n2.5| \u200b| \u200b|  (3.6)  \nNet derivative gains (losses) allocated to Foodservice| \u200b| \u200b|  (0.3)| \u200b| \u200b|\n1.4| \u200b| \u200b|  1.6  \nNet derivative gains (losses) included in segment operating profit| \u200b| $|\n(13.2)| \u200b| $|  19.5| \u200b| $|  32.7  \n  \n\u200b\n\nAs of May 26, 2024, the cumulative amount of net derivative losses from\neconomic hedges that had been recognized in general corporate expenses and not\nyet allocated to reporting segments was $5.1 million.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS\n\nWe have defined benefit retirement plans (\"pension plans\") for eligible\nsalaried and hourly employees. Benefits are based on years of credited service\nand average compensation or stated amounts for each year of service. We also\nsponsor postretirement plans which provide certain medical and dental benefits\nto qualifying U.S. employees. Effective August 1, 2013, our defined benefit\npension plan for eligible salaried employees was closed to new hire salaried\nemployees. New hire salaried employees will generally be eligible to\nparticipate in our defined contribution plan.\n\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company provided a voluntary\nlump-sum settlement offer to certain vested participants in the salaried and\nhourly pension plans in order to reduce a portion of the pension obligation.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2024, approximately $135 million was\ndistributed from the pension plan assets in connection with this offer. The\nlump-sum settlement exceeded our service and interest cost for our hourly\npension plans, requiring a remeasurement in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\nIn connection with the remeasurement, we updated the effective discount rate\nassumption for the impacted pension plan obligations from 5.52% to 5.20%, as\nof December 31, 2023. The settlement and related remeasurement resulted in the\nrecognition of an immaterial settlement loss, reflected in pension and\npostretirement non-service expense (income), as well as a loss in other\ncomprehensive income (loss) totaling $6.8 million in the third quarter of\nfiscal 2024.\n\n\u200b", "\u200b\n\nWe recognize the funded status of our pension and postretirement plans in the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\n\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board guidance establishes a three-level fair\nvalue hierarchy based upon the assumptions (inputs) used to price assets or\nliabilities. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as\nfollows:\n\nLevel 1 -- Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or\nliabilities,\n\nLevel 2 -- Observable inputs other than those included in Level 1, such as\nquoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or quoted\nprices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets, and\n\nLevel 3 -- Unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions and best\nestimate of what inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or\nliability.\n\nThe fair values of our Level 2 derivative instruments were determined using\nvaluation models that use market observable inputs including both forward and\nspot prices for currencies and commodities. Derivative assets and liabilities\nincluded in Level 2 primarily represent commodity and foreign currency option\nand forward contracts.\n\n73\n\n**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n**Fiscal Years Ended May 26, 2024, May 28, 2023, and May 29, 2022**\n\n**(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)**\n\nThe following table presents our financial assets and liabilities measured at\nfair value on a recurring basis, based upon the level within the fair value\nhierarchy in which the fair value measurements fall, as of May 26, 2024:\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n\u200b|  | **Level 1**|  | **Level 2**|  | **Level 3**|  | **Total**  \nAssets:| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b  \nDerivative assets| \u200b| $|  2.3| \u200b| $|  0.7| \u200b| $|  --| \u200b| $|  3.0  \nDeferred compensation assets| \u200b| \u200b|  6.3| \u200b| \u200b|  --| \u200b| \u200b|  --| \u200b| \u200b|  6.3  \nAvailable-for-sale debt securities| \u200b| \u200b|  --| \u200b| \u200b|  --| \u200b| \u200b|  2.9| \u200b| \u200b|\n2.9  \nTotal assets| \u200b| $|  8.6| \u200b| $|  0.7| \u200b| $|  2.9| \u200b| $|  12.2  \nLiabilities:| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b  \nDerivative liabilities| \u200b| $|  --| \u200b| $|  3.6| \u200b| $|  --| \u200b| $|  3.6  \nDeferred compensation liabilities| \u200b| \u200b|  70.4| \u200b| \u200b|  --| \u200b| \u200b|  --| \u200b| \u200b|\n70.4  \nTotal liabilities| \u200b| $|  70.4| \u200b| $|  3.6| \u200b| $|  --| \u200b| $|  74.0  \n  \n\u200b\n\nThe following table presents our financial assets and liabilities measured at\nfair value on a recurring basis, based upon the level within the fair value\nhierarchy in which the fair value measurements fall, as of May 28, 2023:\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n\u200b|  | **Level 1**|  | **Level 2**|  | **Level 3**|  | **Total**  \nAssets:| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b  \nDerivative assets| \u200b| $|  9.4| \u200b| $|  0.6| \u200b| $|  --| \u200b| $|  10.0  \nDeferred compensation assets| \u200b| \u200b|  7.1| \u200b| \u200b|  --| \u200b| \u200b|  --| \u200b| \u200b|  7.1  \nAvailable-for-sale debt securities| \u200b| \u200b|  --| \u200b| \u200b|  --| \u200b| \u200b|  4.0| \u200b| \u200b|\n4.0  \nTotal assets| \u200b| $|  16.5| \u200b| $|  0.6| \u200b| $|  4.0| \u200b| $|  21.1  \nLiabilities:| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b| \u200b  \nDerivative liabilities| \u200b| $|  --| \u200b| $|  3.6| \u200b| $|  --| \u200b| $|  3.6  \nDeferred compensation liabilities| \u200b| \u200b|  67.0| \u200b| \u200b|  --| \u200b| \u200b|  --| \u200b| \u200b|\n67.0  \nTotal liabilities| \u200b| $|  67.0| \u200b| $|  3.6| \u200b| $|  --| \u200b| $|  70.6  \n  \n\u200b\n\nNonrecurring Fair Value Measurements", "Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements\n\nCertain assets and liabilities, including long-lived assets, goodwill, asset\nretirement obligations, and equity investments are measured at fair value on a\nnonrecurring basis using Level 3 inputs.\n\n_Impairment of Assets Held for Sale_\n\nIn fiscal 2024, we recognized impairment charges totaling $36.4 million in our\nInternational segment.

Those\nstandards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective\ninternal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material\nrespects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing\nprocedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated\nfinancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test\nbasis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated\nfinancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as\nevaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.\nOur audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk\nthat a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and\noperating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.

A company's internal\ncontrol over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that\n(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets\nof the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are\nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts\nand expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with\nauthorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention\n\n78\n\n**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n**Fiscal Years Ended May 26, 2024, May 28, 2023, and May 29, 2022**\n\n**(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)**\n\nor timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the\ncompany's assets that could have a material effect on the financial\nstatements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting\nmay not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation\nof effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may\nbecome inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nCritical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the\ncurrent period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that:\n(1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated\nfinancial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective,\nor complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken\nas a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,\nproviding a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts\nor disclosures to which it relates.\n\nEvaluation of the recoverability of the carrying value of the Birds Eye\nindefinite-lived intangible asset and goodwill assigned to the Sides,\nComponents, Enhancers reporting unit\n\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements,\nindefinite-lived intangible assets (consisting primarily of brand names and\ntrademarks) and goodwill as of May 26, 2024, excluding amounts classified as\nheld for sale (see Note 6), were $2.03 billion and $10.58 billion,\nrespectively. For the fiscal year ended May 26, 2024, the Company recorded\nimpairment charges totaling $430.2 million and $526.5 million on indefinite-\nlived intangible assets and goodwill, respectively. In assessing indefinite-\nlived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment, the Company performs\neither a qualitative or quantitative assessment at least annually or whenever\ncircumstances indicate a potential impairment exists. On the annual impairment\nassessment date, the Company estimated the fair value of its Birds Eye\nindefinite-lived intangible asset by using a discounted cash flow method that\nincorporates an estimated royalty rate that would be charged to a third party\nfor the use of the brand. The Company estimated the fair value of its Sides,\nComponents, Enhancers reporting unit by using a combination of a discounted\ncash flow method and guideline public company method. Impairment charges are\nrecorded for any intangible assets or goodwill with carrying values in excess\nof their respective estimated fair values.", "We identified the evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying value of\nthe Birds Eye indefinite-lived intangible asset and the goodwill assigned to\nthe Sides, Components, Enhancers reporting unit as a critical audit matter.\nSubjective and challenging auditor judgment was required to evaluate certain\nassumptions used in determining the fair value of these assets. These\nassumptions included the forecasted revenue growth rates including the\nterminal growth rates and forecasted margins, royalty rate, discount rates,\nand the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization\n(EBITDA) market multiple. Changes to these assumptions could have had a\nsignificant effect on the Company's assessment of the carrying value of the\nBirds Eye indefinite-lived intangible asset and the goodwill assigned to the\nSides, Components, Enhancers reporting unit.\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical\naudit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness\nof certain internal controls over the quantitative impairment assessments,\nincluding controls over the development of the assumptions described above.
