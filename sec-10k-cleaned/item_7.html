<span>ITEM 7.</span><span>MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS</span><div></div><div><span>Please read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with “Note about Forward-Looking Statements,” Part I, Item 1 "Business," Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors," and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. </span></div><div><span>We have omitted discussion of 2020 results where it would be redundant to the discussion previously included in Item 7 of our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.</span></div><div></div><div><span>Understanding Alphabet’s Financial Results</span></div><div><span>Alphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, Google Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For further details on our segments, see Part I, Item 1 “Business” and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.</span></div><div></div><div><span>Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect</span></div><div><span>The following long-term trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate that they will continue to affect our future results:</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>Users' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves.</span></div><div><span>The continuing shift from an offline to online world has contributed to the growth of our business and our revenues since inception. We expect that this shift to an online world will continue to benefit our business and our revenues, although at a slower pace than we have experienced historically, in particular after the outsized growth in our advertising revenues during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we face increasing competition for user engagement and advertisers, which may affect our revenues.</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>Users continue to access our products and services using diverse devices and modalities, which allows for new advertising formats that may benefit our revenues but adversely affect our margins. </span></div><div><span>Our users are accessing the Internet via diverse devices and modalities, such as smartphones, wearables, and smart home devices, and want to be able to be connected no matter where they are or what they are doing. We are focused on expanding our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to maintain and grow our business.</span></div><div><span>We benefit from advertising revenues generated from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising formats. The margins from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop search. Additionally, as the market for a particular device type or modality matures, our advertising revenues may be affected. For example, growth in the global smartphone market has slowed due to various factors, including increased market saturation in developed countries, which can affect our mobile advertising revenues.</span></div><div><span>We expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow and TAC as a percentage of our advertising revenues ("TAC rate") to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic mix; partner mix; partner agreement terms; the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points; product mix; the relative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels; and revenue share terms.</span></div><div><span>We expect these trends to continue to affect our revenues and put pressure on our margins.</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>As online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings, which may affect our monetization.</span></div><div><span>As interactions between users and advertisers change, and as online user behavior evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings to serve these changing needs, which may affect our monetization. For example, revenues from ads on YouTube and Google Play monetize at a lower rate than our traditional search ads. We also may develop new products incorporating AI innovations that could affect our monetization trends. Additionally, when developing new products and services we generally focus first on user experience before prioritizing monetization.</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>As users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets continue to increase, and may require continued investments. In addition, movements in foreign exchange rates affect such revenues. </span></div><div><span>The shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the U.S., including in emerging markets, such as India. We continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our products and advertising programs relevant to our users in these markets. This has led to a trend of increased </span></div><div><div><div><span>26</span></div></div></div><hr/><div><div><table><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div><span></span></div></td><td><span>Alphabet Inc.</span></td></tr></table></div></div><div><span>revenues from emerging markets. We expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these markets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available. This trend could affect our revenues as developing markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets.</span></div><div><span>International revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings.</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>The revenues that we derive from non-advertising products and services are increasing and may adversely affect our margins.</span></div><div><span>Non-advertising revenues have grown over time, and we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our products and services. The margins on these revenues vary significantly and are generally lower than the margins on our advertising revenues. In particular margins on our hardware products adversely affect our consolidated margins due to pressures on pricing and higher cost of sales.</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>As we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and capital expenditures.</span></div><div><span>We continue to make significant research and development investments in areas of strategic focus as we seek to develop new, innovative offerings and improve our existing offerings across our businesses. We also expect to continue to invest in our technical infrastructure, including servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term initiatives, in particular in support of AI. In addition acquisitions and strategic investments contribute to the breadth and depth of our offerings, expand our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, and build strong partnerships around strategic initiatives. For example, in September 2022 we closed the acquisition of Mandiant to help expand our offerings in dynamic cyber defense and response. </span></div><div><span>•</span><span>We face continuing changes in regulatory conditions, laws, and public policies, which could affect our business practices and financial results.</span></div><div><span>Changes in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide range of topics and related legal matters have resulted in fines and caused us to change our business practices. As these global trends continue, our cost of doing business may increase, our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products or services may be limited, and we may need to change our business practices. Examples include the antitrust complaints filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and a number of state Attorneys General; pending litigation in the U.S., EU, and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for websites and online platforms; and the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act in Europe and various legislative proposals in the U.S. focused on large technology platforms. For additional information see Item 1A Risk Factors and Legal Matters in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8.</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>Our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them.</span></div><div><span>Our employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. We expect to continue hiring talented employees around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs. For additional information see Culture and Workforce in Part I, Item 1 “Business.”</span></div><div></div><div><span>Revenues and Monetization Metrics</span></div><div><span>We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products. For details on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.</span></div><div><span>In addition to the long-term trends and their financial effect on our business noted above, fluctuations in our revenues have been and may continue to be affected by a combination of factors, including:</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>changes in foreign currency exchange rates;</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>changes in pricing, such as those resulting from changes in fee structures, discounts, and customer incentives;</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>general economic conditions and various external dynamics, including geopolitical events, regulations, and other measures and their effect on advertiser, consumer, and enterprise spending; </span></div><div><span>•</span><span>new product and service launches; and</span></div><div><div><div><span>27</span></div></div></div><hr/><div><div><table><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div><span></span></div></td><td><span>Alphabet Inc.</span></td></tr></table></div></div><div><span>•</span><span>seasonality.</span></div><div><span>Additionally, fluctuations in our revenues generated from advertising ("Google advertising"), revenues from other sources ("Google other revenues"), Google Cloud, and Other Bets revenues have been and may continue to be affected by other factors unique to each set of revenues, as described below.</span></div><div><span>Google Services</span></div><div><span>Google Services revenues consist of Google advertising as well as Google other revenues.</span></div><div><span>Google Advertising</span></div><div><span>Google advertising revenues are comprised of the following: </span></div><div><span>•</span><span>Google Search &amp; other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>Google Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.</span></div><div><span>We use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our advertising revenues: paid clicks and cost-per-click pertain to traffic on Google Search &amp; other properties, while impressions and cost-per-impression pertain to traffic on our Google Network properties.</span></div><div><span>Paid clicks represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users on Google search properties and other Google owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play. Cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.</span></div><div><span>Impressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression displayed to users.</span></div><div><span>As our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues generated by the corresponding click and impression activity.</span></div><div><span>Fluctuations in our advertising revenues, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search &amp; other properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties and the correlation between these items have been and may continue to be affected by additional factors, such as:</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>advertiser competition for keywords;</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>changes in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy;</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>changes in device mix; </span></div><div><span>•</span><span>seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends, such as traditional retail seasonality; and</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various verticals and channels.</span></div><div><span>Google Other</span></div><div><span>Google other revenues are comprised of the following:</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>Google Play, which includes sales of apps and in-app purchases;</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>hardware, which includes sales of Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel devices;</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>YouTube non-advertising, which includes subscription revenues from services such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV; and</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>other products and services.</span></div><div><div><div><span>28</span></div></div></div><hr/><div><div><table><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div><span></span></div></td><td><span>Alphabet Inc.</span></td></tr></table></div></div><div><span>Fluctuations in our Google other revenues have been and may continue to be affected by additional factors, such as changes in customer usage and demand, number of subscribers, and fluctuations in the timing of product launches.</span></div><div><span>Google Cloud</span></div><div><span>Google Cloud revenues are comprised of the following:</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>Google Cloud Platform, which includes fees for infrastructure, platform, and other services;</span></div><div><span>•</span><span>Google Workspace, which includes fees for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for enterprises, such as Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar and Meet; and </span></div><div><span>•</span><span>other enterprise services.</span></div><div><span>Fluctuations in our Google Cloud revenues have been and may continue to be affected by additional factors, such as customer usage.</span></div><div><span>Other Bets</span></div><div><span>Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.</span></div><div></div><div><span>Costs and Expenses </span></div><div><span>Our cost structure has two components: cost of revenues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses include costs related to R&amp;D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions.

We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues ("constant currency revenues") and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues ("percentage change in constant currency revenues") for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) results helps improve the ability to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.</span></div><div><span>Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements ("FX Effect") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.</span></div><div><div><div><span>33</span></div></div></div><hr/><div><div><table><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div><span></span></div></td><td><span>Alphabet Inc.</span></td></tr></table></div></div><div><span>Constant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period revenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods.</span></div><div><span>These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP.

In 2021, $9.8 billion of net unrealized gains were recognized on non-marketable equity securities and $1.5 billion of interest income was recognized, partially offset by $1.9 billion of accrued performance fees related to certain investments.</span></div><div><span>See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.</span></div><div></div><div><span>Provision for Income Taxes</span></div><div><span>The following table presents provision for income taxes (in millions, except for effective tax rate):</span></div><div><table><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><span> </span></td><td></td><td></td><td><span>Year Ended December 31,</span></td></tr><tr><td><span> </span></td><td></td><td></td><td><span>2021</span></td><td></td><td><span>2022</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>Income before provision for income taxes</span></td><td></td><td></td><td><span>$</span></td><td><span>90,734 </span></td><td></td><td></td><td><span>$</span></td><td><span>71,328 </span></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><span>Provision for income taxes</span></td><td></td><td></td><td><span>$</span></td><td><span>14,701 </span></td><td></td><td></td><td><span>$</span></td><td><span>11,356 </span></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><span>Effective tax rate</span></td><td></td><td></td><td><span>16.2 </span></td><td><span>%</span></td><td></td><td><span>15.9 </span></td><td><span>%</span></td></tr></table></div><div><span>The effective tax rate decreased from 2021 to 2022, primarily driven by the effects of capitalization and amortization of R&amp;D expenses in 2022 as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act generating an increase in the U.S. federal Foreign Derived Intangible Income tax deduction. The decrease was partially offset by a decrease in pre-tax earnings, including in countries that have lower statutory rates and a decrease in the stock-based compensation related tax benefit.

As of December 31, 2022, the amount of total future lease payments under operating leases, which had a weighted average remaining lease term of 8 years, was $17.4 billion, of which $3.0 billion is short-term. As of December 31, 2022, we have entered into leases that have not yet commenced with future short-term and long-term lease payments of $630 million and $3.1 billion that are not yet recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These leases will commence between 2023 and 2026 with non-cancelable lease terms of 1 to 25 years.</span></div><div><span>For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, our operating lease expenses (including variable lease costs) were $3.4 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. Finance lease costs were not material for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022.

As of December 31, 2022, $28.1 billion remains available for Class A and Class C share repurchases. In accordance with the authorization of the Board of Directors of Alphabet, during 2022 we repurchased and subsequently retired 530 million shares for $59.3 billion. Of the aggregate amount repurchased and subsequently retired, 61 million shares were Class A stock for $6.7 billion and 469 million shares were Class C stock for $52.6 billion.

On September 14, 2022, the General Court reduced the 2018 fine from €4.3 billion to €4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal to the European Court of Justice. In 2018 we recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in 2022. </span></div><div><span>While each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines.

We also have taxes payable of $5.1 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of </span><span>December 31, 2022</span><span>. </span></div><div></div><div><span>Purchase Commitments </span></div><div><span>As of December 31, 2022, we had material non-cancelable contractual obligations of </span><span>$32.0 billion</span><span>, of which $17.3 billion was short-term. These amounts represent the non-cancelable portion of agreements or the minimum cancellation fee and are primarily related to commitments to purchase licenses, technical infrastructure, inventory, and network capacity. For those agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of December 31, 2022. </span></div><div><span>In addition we regularly enter into multi-year, non-cancellable agreements to purchase renewable energy and energy attributes, such as renewable energy certificates. These agreements do not include a minimum dollar commitment. The amounts to be paid under these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated and are not readily determinable. </span></div><div></div><div><span>Critical Accounting Estimates</span></div><div><span>We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions. Our critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of uncertainty at the time the estimate was made, and changes in them have had or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We have reviewed our critical accounting estimates with the Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors.</span></div><div><span>See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements.</span></div><div><span>Fair Value Measurements of Non-Marketable Equity Securities</span></div><div><span>We measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, consisting primarily of our non-marketable equity securities. These investments are accounted for under the measurement alternative method ("the measurement alternative") and are measured at cost, less impairment, subject to upward and downward adjustments resulting from observable price changes for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. These adjustments require quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities, which may require the use of unobservable inputs. Pricing adjustments are determined by using various valuation methodologies and involve the use of estimates using the best information available, which may include cash flow projections or other available market data.</span></div><div><span>Non-marketable equity securities are also evaluated for impairment, based on qualitative factors including the companies' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among others. When indicators of impairment exist, we prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income approach, which requires judgment and the use of unobservable inputs, including discount rates, investee revenues and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others. When the quantitative remeasurements of fair value indicate an impairment exists, we write down the investment to its current fair value.</span></div><div><span>We also have compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain investments, i.e. performance fees. We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may result in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use of unobservable inputs.</span></div><div><span>Property and Equipment</span></div><div><span>We assess the reasonableness of the useful lives of our property and equipment periodically as well as when other changes occur, such as when there are changes to ongoing business operations, changes in the planned use and utilization of assets, or technological advancements, that could indicate a change in the period over which we expect to benefit from the assets. </span></div><div><div><div><span>39</span></div></div></div><hr/><div><div><table><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div><span></span></div></td><td><span>Alphabet Inc.</span></td></tr></table></div></div><div><span>Income Taxes</span></div><div><span>We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.</span></div><div><span>Recording an uncertain tax position involves various qualitative considerations, including evaluation of comparable and resolved tax exposures, applicability of tax laws, and likelihood of settlement. We evaluate uncertain tax positions periodically, considering changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial opinions, as well as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.</span></div><div><span>The provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Services (IRS) and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.</span></div><div><span>Loss Contingencies</span></div><div><span>We are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury consumer protection, and other matters. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. </span></div><div><span>We evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our disclosures as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters. Until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. </span></div><div><span>Change in Accounting Estimate</span></div><div><span>In January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment, resulting in a change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment to six years, which we expect to result in a reduction of depreciation of approximately $3.4 billion for the full fiscal year 2023 for assets in service as of December 31, 2022, recorded primarily in cost of revenues and R&amp;D expenses. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information relating to the useful lives of our servers and network equipment.</span></div><div></div><div></div>
